        "text": "Here\u2019s what the Fearless Fund lawsuit could mean for venture\nThe first official piece of policy around diversity efforts in venture capital may soon see the light of day, but not because of any action by the government.\nIn a complaint filed this week, the American Alliance for Equal Rights \u2014 founded by conservative activist Edward Blum, the man driving the effort to end affirmative action \u2014 sued a minority-focused venture capital fund for unlawful racial discrimination.\nIn the complaint, the organization accuses Fearless Fund (an early-stage venture capital firm based in Atlanta that focuses on funding solely to women founders of color) of racially discriminating against non-Black individuals by having a $20,000 grant program for only Black women who are small-business owners.\nThe program is the Fearless Strivers Grant Contest, and the fund hosts it four times a year in partnership with Mastercard. The American Alliance for Equal Rights alleges that Fearless Fund is violating Section 1981 of the 1866 Civil Rights Act, which states that private contracts must be made and enforced without regard to race.\nIt\u2019s still too early to draw winners and losers in this battle, but if the American Alliance for Equal Rights wins this lawsuit, it could result in the first official piece of law around diversity, equity and inclusion in venture capital. The result could very well set a lasting precedent for how the entire startup ecosystem evolves. And given Blum\u2019s recent record, a loss for Fearless Fund could be on the cards.\nGregory Shill, a professor of law at the University of Iowa who teaches a class on the Civil Rights Act as part of his Contracts class, told TechCrunch+ that a victory by Blum and the American Alliance for Equal Rights would stop many of the efforts designed to address the current disparities within venture capital.\nThe Civil Rights Act was the first piece of federal civil rights legislation passed in the U.S., enacted to guarantee that contracts would be honored regardless of race. At the time, it was widely held at the time that the market was open to everyone, but it wasn\u2019t really.\n\u201cFor years, Black founders have complained of discrimination, but they have been effectively blocked from doing anything about it, because, to prevail, they must show that the discrimination is intentional,\u201d he said, adding that many avoid doing so because it can be harmful to their careers. \u201cSo rather than challenging this head-on, one alternative tack has been to set up funds that specifically recruit Black or women founders. That effort is what is being challenged here.\u201d\nBlum told TechCrunch+ that the American Alliance for Equal Rights was contacted by a woman-owned business that asked to help challenge Fearless Fund. \u201cThe program being challenged is racially exclusive, thus violating our nation\u2019s civil rights laws. It is to be hoped that other programs like this one end these practices and offer the benefits to all small businesses regardless of the owner\u2019s race,\u201d he said.\nFearless Fund did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nFearless Fund was founded in 2019 with the sole purpose of backing entrepreneurs who are women of color. Just a few weeks ago, TechCrunch reported that the fund raised an undisclosed amount, with the goal to deploy at least $50 million as part of its second fund. It is also currently in the process of hosting one of its grant contests.\nBlum has a history of teaming up with individuals to sue race-based policies. For this latest suit, he told Reuters that the white and Asian American members of the American Alliance for Equal Rights were excluded from the grant because of race.\nRecently, he sued Harvard to overturn affirmative action, saying it discriminated against Asian Americans, and assisted a young white woman in suing the University of Texas over affirmative action, though he lost that last case.\nThomas Dorwart, a managing partner at law firm Thomas C. Dorwart Law, said the American Alliance for Equal Rights could have a chance to win, but not based on the UNC and Harvard affirmative action cases. That\u2019s because the court\u2019s ruling there applied only to government funding.\nThe Supreme Court \u201chas held that the statute cited by Blum applies to the employer-employee relationship. It could be argued that Fearless Fund is only an investor and is not an employer of the grantees. Thus, Blum\u2019s and SCOTUS\u2019 reasoning do not apply,\u201d Dorwart told TechCrunch+. \u201cFurther, SCOTUS, in the recent affirmative action decision, did not address military academies, and let stand that diversity may be considered by military academies. That same reasoning could apply in venture capital, especially considering the funding gap.\u201d\nStill, as Jomayra Herrera, an investor at Reach Capital, noted, this is an important reminder that venture capital is not immune to the broader political polarization that is happening across the country.\nMinority fund managers and founders are understandably nervous. According to Luke Cooper, the founder of Latimer Ventures, which focuses on backing founders from Black and Latinx communities, this suit would only make it harder for Black founders to receive funding. Grant programs such as the one Fearless Fund offers are often the only way such founders can access money.\n\u201cAn event like this is deeply concerning because it holds existential risk to the good work that many of us are doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will have the unintended consequence of shedding light on the tattered cordage of this industry\u2019s rigging.\u201d\nBrandon Brooks, a founding partner at Overlooked Ventures, called this a \u201cbullshit case\u201d but conceded that Blum was likely to win, especially after his success with toppling affirmative action in college admissions.\n\u201cAny funds or sub-funds based on diversity investing will have to shift focus; LPs will be scared to invest in those funds for fear of lawsuits,\u201d he added.\nIndeed, there is a new crop of diverse fund managers from overlooked backgrounds who are focused on funding their communities. \u201cThis case will certainly impact Black and even female-focused funds,\u201d Dorwart said. \u201cBut, again, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how it plays out, considering these are not employer-employee relationships. Perhaps the court will hold that any funds that receive funding from government entities or institutions are subject to the statute Blum cites.\u201d\nThe American Alliance for Equal Rights winning could result in more litigation overall against businesses, universities and government agencies\u2019 programs that target marginalized groups, Shill said. This could turn out to be detrimental to not only Black people, but also all people from underrepresented backgrounds.\nKate Tamera, a trans founder of gender-affirming health service Euphoria, stressed how much founders like her rely on grant programs since funding for trans people is almost nonexistent.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no concrete evidence to support the claim that majority founders are being denied equal opportunities when the existing system already disproportionately favors them at the expense of minority founders,\u201d she said.\nShill said that Blum\u2019s victory would also likely not have an impact on the funds that exclusively or disproportionately back white founders, explaining that funds that do this often do so subtly and implicitly, and the direction of the law in the last few years makes it very difficult to prevail on such a claim.\nInstead, it\u2019s likely that this grant contest would be shut down or retooled, and \u201cother efforts at remediating the effects of racism in this country will be more vulnerable legally,\u201d he said.\nBut even if Blum ends up winning, it doesn\u2019t mean that funding for Black founders has to stop. \u201cIf he wins, Fearless Fund\u2019s solution, in my view, is to still provide grants that benefit Black women, or Black founders in general, but to [also] provide some smaller percentage of grants to other races,\u201d Dowart said.\nHe also believes, though, that the same type of lawsuit has just as much of a chance as succeeding against the typical large VC funds \u201csince Black and women founders are at like less than 2% of funding,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey are being forced out of the market and discriminated against in the same way under the same statute.\u201d\nThis story was updated to add a quote by Thomas Dorwart and clarify the class Gregory Shill teaches, along with Blum\u2019s Harvard suit."

        "text": "Dan Gwak of Point72 Ventures on why defense tech is becoming the next big thing for investors\nDan Gwak has had a more varied life than many investors. He grew up in Jakarta, the son of Korean parents who ran a shipping business. After high school, he headed to Cornell in the U.S. and became an associate at The Carlyle Group.\nEverything was moving up and to the right, so to speak. Then, like a gut punch, the financial recession hit in 2008.\nGwak was among many who suddenly found themselves on uneven footing and evaluating their next steps. Unlike most of his young investing peers, Gwak quickly decided to join the U.S. Marine Corps as a machine gunner. It seemed like a natural decision, given that in Korea, where military service is compulsory for men between ages 18 and 35, both Gwak\u2019s father and brother had served. It was also Gwak\u2019s way of \u201cbecoming American,\u201d he says.\nWhile he wasn\u2019t expecting his service to end four years later in Afghanistan \u2014 he was wounded and sent home \u2014 Gwak again didn\u2019t waste much time deliberating about his next moves. He applied and was accepted to Harvard Business School, and nearly since that time, he has been investing at the intersection of national security and technology. Out of school, he joined In-Q-Tel, which is the venture arm of the CIA. In 2017, when the billionaire hedge fund manager \u201cStevie\u201d Cohen decided to build out a venture practice \u2014 Point72 Ventures \u2014 he poached Gwak, and Gwak has remained active since, including leading a 50-person team that has invested more than $1 billion into roughly 130 companies on Cohen\u2019s behalf.\nThe deals range across four key areas: deep tech, fintech, enterprise and defense tech. But in a lengthy conversation with Gwak earlier today, he talked the longest about defense tech as he\u2019s passionate about it and because the way he sees it, Washington is focused more than ever on the global balance of power \u2014 and looking for any edge it can find. Below are excerpts from that part of our chat, edited lightly for length and clarity. You can listen to the entire conversation here.\nTC: You have these four areas on which you\u2019re focused, but fintech has cooled off after several frothy years, and defense tech now seems top of mind for investors. Is that true inside Point72?\nDG: Absolutely. If you rewind the clock, fintech was an area that was very hot and we were very active in deploying a lot of capital. Today, the area that\u2019s really come up is defense tech. It\u2019s not just that the market in general has corrected, but rather, I think defense tech, specifically as an opportunity, has really [gained traction] among other venture investors, as well as founders [along with a growing] awareness of the importance of defense tech to the government.\nGiven your experience over the years, working for and selling to the government, does the sales process move any more quickly than historically? The long-standing knock, of course, is that it\u2019s too bureaucratic and there\u2019s too much red tape to get past.\nEven five years ago, I would have told you that defense tech investing the way that we think about it \u2014 which is investing in companies whose primary customer is going to be the Department of Defense \u2014 is a bad idea for exactly the reason that you describe. But that has changed for a couple of big reasons. First of all, the government is generally inefficient at buying things until something comes along that has the potential to shift the global superpower balance, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing today. If you look at the last time that happened, that was probably pursuing the atom bomb and the Manhattan Project. When you look at things like AI and all the ways it applies \u2014 whether that\u2019s autonomy or computer vision or natural language processing \u2014 these are all things that absolutely can shift the global superpower balance, and the government sees that now. And when the government sees that, then it becomes much, much better at buying things.\nIt seems like a portfolio company of yours, Shield AI, falls into this category. [Editor\u2019s note: Shield AI develops AI-powered fighter pilots and drones that it sells to the U.S. Air Force and U.S Army.]\nAutonomous drone swarms do have the ability to shift the global superpower balance, whoever gets that right and can release a drone swarm of thousands. That is an approach [against which there are] just not good defenses today, even if you own the largest aircraft carrier fleet in the universe. [And because a company like Shield AI can help in] the future preparedness of America, it can, as a result, get a lot of the funding that comes out of the government. It used to be because of the slower sales cycles and so forth, you had to kind of count on the prize being larger but taking longer to get to. [Today] we\u2019re finally entering a time where, as long as you align with something that really, really matters to the government and you can connect the dots effectively, you can grow that business as quickly as as any commercial business,\nWhat has Ukraine meant for its business?\nUkraine\u2019s impact on defense tech has been a very catalyzing one. Everyone understood even before Ukraine that drone swarms and the effective use of attributable technologies and things like that could have a very big impact. Ukraine just serves to highlight that in real life. When you look at what\u2019s going on there, that effective use of drones has had a massive impact in that battlefield.\nSo-called slaughterbots are autonomous drones that are programmed to kill people without any human intervention. How does a company like Shield AI deal with potential customers that might misuse its technology?\nI don\u2019t want to speak on the company\u2019s behalf on that topic because it is a conversation that the company should have with its customers, and I\u2019m not necessarily in those conversations. However, I think the overall topic \u2014 the danger posed by autonomy when it comes to taking human beings out of that decision to attack \u2014 is a very interesting one. To my mind, it\u2019s all about system design. Any weapon in the world that has a kinetic effect can be very, very dangerous \u2014 to the enemy, to ourselves, and to noncombatants who just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.That\u2019s why when you look at all these kinetic systems, there\u2019s always good system design around the decision to take an action, and a human being is usually in the loop. When it comes to this new wave of technology, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re throwing that concept of safety out the window. Good, sound, system design, as informed by the risks that we are willing to\u00a0 subject ourselves to, is always going to be an important part of the equation.\nThe U.S. government is a big customer that can demand that things are tailored for its purposes. Does it preclude these companies from selling to other governments? How does that work? Do they have to get buy-in from Washington?\nIt depends on what other country we\u2019re talking about [laughs]. To contextualize with numbers, though, the overall spending of the United States and all of its allies on defense is $1.6 trillion. That is a gigantic market. It is an order of magnitude larger than the commercial SaaS market. Of that 1.6 trillion, fully 50% of it is just the U.S. So when you see defense tech companies so focused on the U.S. defense market, there\u2019s a good sound reason for that. That [also] means that if that largest part of the market is asking you not to interact with nations that might be adversarial to the United States, you\u2019re going to respect that.\nAre the investors interested in these deals changing at all? I know who some of the players are \u2014 you, In-Q-Tel, Lux.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nLux is certainly one that\u2019s been investing where deep tech meets defense tech for a while. [There]\u2019s also Founders Fund, 8VC, a16z as part of their American dynamism effort. There is a core group of half a dozen or so that have been focused on defense tech for a while. Now I\u2019m seeing additional investors, tier one venture investors, who were not necessarily historically interested in defense tech, start to be a lot more interested. That\u2019s a good thing. The opportunity is just so large. If you think about it, the DoD has an $800 billion budget and only 1% of that today goes to startups.\nThat\u2019s an incredible stat. I guess I have the headline to this story now. Who gets the rest? Lockheed Martin?\nIt\u2019s largely the defense primes today, which serve an important purpose. But the truly transformational technologies that the DoD needs to be able to harness in the next 10 years, those are going to come from startups."

        "text": "Astra lays off 25% of workforce, reallocates engineers, in an effort to fight dwindling cash reserves\nAstra has laid off 25% of its workforce since the beginning of the quarter and is reallocating at least 50 engineers and manufacturing staff away from its launch business to focus on spacecraft production, the company said Friday.\nThe reallocation and layoffs are expected to delay testing of the under-development Rocket 4 and Launch System 2.0, Astra said. The affected employees worked in the company\u2019s launch, sales and administration and \u201cshared services\u201d departments. Workforce reductions are expected to save the company more than $4 million per quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of this year.\nAstra, which is facing dwindling cash reserves, is no doubt looking for a way to further reduce operating expenses while also bolstering its spacecraft engine business, the only business unit that currently has a near-term chance of generating revenue. The spacecraft engine technology is sourced from Astra\u2019s acquisition of propulsion developer Apollo Fusion, which closed the day Astra went public in July 2021.\nIndeed, Astra said that it had closed 278 committed orders of the Astra Spacecraft Engine product through\u00a0the end of March, which totals around $77 million in contracts once the engines are delivered. A \u201csubstantial majority\u201d of these orders will be delivered through the end of 2024, the company said.\n\u201cWe are intensely focused on delivering on our commitments to our customers, which includes ensuring we have sufficient resources and an adequate financial runway to execute on our near-term opportunities,\u201d Chris Kemp, CEO and founder, said in a statement.\nAstra also said that it had engaged investment bank PJT Partners as a financial advisor as it looks for more capital to continue operations. That includes \u201cpotential strategic investments in the Astra Spacecraft Engine business to strengthen Astra\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d the company said. Separately, Astra said it had raised $10.8 million in a debt sale to investment group High Trail Capital.\nAccording to preliminary second-quarter financial results, Astra is expected to have revenues between $0.5-$1 million, while having just $26-$26.5 million in cash on hand.\nThis is not the first time major layoffs have hit the space company. Last November, Astra announced it had let go of 16% of its employees, also to focus on launch and spacecraft engines."

Yet, around the same time, Pony claimed to be worth $8.5 billion (and that\u2019s the last we\u2019ve heard of its valuation to date).\nPony isn\u2019t alone in its trials.

        "text": "SoftBank sues IRL over \u2018elaborate scheme\u2019 that swallowed $150M\nSoftBank once invested in social app IRL at a $1.1 billion valuation. Now, the Japanese investment firm is suing the defunct company for fraud, alleging $150 million in damages.\nIRL was supposedly poised to become an event organizing alternative for Gen Z, who are using Facebook less and less. Its self-reported numbers were impressive enough to solicit a $170 million Series C led by SoftBank in 2021, but earlier this summer, an internal investigation by IRL\u2019s board of directors found that 95% of the app\u2019s users were fake.\nIn its legal complaint, SoftBank explains that it was moved to invest in IRL because of its impressive user numbers; the app claimed it had been downloaded by 25% of U.S. teens under 28 years old and was growing at a 400% year-over-year rate. But per the IRL board\u2019s investigation, none of these figures were accurate.\nInvestors don\u2019t always do their due diligence, but SoftBank claims it wouldn\u2019t have been possible to verify IRL\u2019s fake user numbers, since it had \u201cprepared for SoftBank\u2019s due diligence and structured IRL\u2019s business so that SoftBank could not discover evidence of their fraud.\u201d SoftBank explains in detail its attempts at conducting due diligence before forking over a nine-figure sum.\nPer SoftBank\u2019s claims, IRL was spending tens of thousands of dollars on proxy services to fraudulently inflate IRL\u2019s user data with bots. SoftBank also accused IRL of paying hundreds of thousands of dollars per month to a secret firm operated by IRL\u2019s head of Growth to cover up this scheme.\n\u201cBecause IRL did not have any profitable revenue stream, its value to an outside investor like SoftBank depended on its active user metrics as a source of potential future income,\u201d SoftBank\u2019s complaint reads. \u201cThus, SoftBank relied on the accuracy of representations from IRL\u2019s executives concerning both the quantity and quality of IRL\u2019s users.\u201d\nReached via text, IRL CEO Abraham Shafi did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment. Shafi is named as a defendant in the complaint, as are five of his siblings and cousins, who SoftBank alleges were part of this cover-up. Each of these family members sold IRL common stock to SoftBank in connection with these investments.\nWhen SoftBank accessed a third-party report on IRL\u2019s total users and downloads, the data said that by spring 2021, IRL had only been downloaded 9 million times. Shafi, on the other hand, was claiming that the app had 12 million monthly active users, and that 2 million events got planned each day on IRL. Shafi explained away this discrepancy by saying that the number accounted neither for web sessions, nor underage users, whose data could not be shared.\n\u201cIn reality, the platform was a virtual ghost town, filled with bots deceptively mimicking active human users,\u201d SoftBank wrote.\nIn addition to this lawsuit, IRL is being probed by the SEC to determine whether the app violated security laws by misleading investors.\n"
