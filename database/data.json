        "text": "Here\u2019s what the Fearless Fund lawsuit could mean for venture\nThe first official piece of policy around diversity efforts in venture capital may soon see the light of day, but not because of any action by the government.\nIn a complaint filed this week, the American Alliance for Equal Rights \u2014 founded by conservative activist Edward Blum, the man driving the effort to end affirmative action \u2014 sued a minority-focused venture capital fund for unlawful racial discrimination.\nIn the complaint, the organization accuses Fearless Fund (an early-stage venture capital firm based in Atlanta that focuses on funding solely to women founders of color) of racially discriminating against non-Black individuals by having a $20,000 grant program for only Black women who are small-business owners.\nThe program is the Fearless Strivers Grant Contest, and the fund hosts it four times a year in partnership with Mastercard. The American Alliance for Equal Rights alleges that Fearless Fund is violating Section 1981 of the 1866 Civil Rights Act, which states that private contracts must be made and enforced without regard to race.\nIt\u2019s still too early to draw winners and losers in this battle, but if the American Alliance for Equal Rights wins this lawsuit, it could result in the first official piece of law around diversity, equity and inclusion in venture capital. The result could very well set a lasting precedent for how the entire startup ecosystem evolves. And given Blum\u2019s recent record, a loss for Fearless Fund could be on the cards.\nGregory Shill, a professor of law at the University of Iowa who teaches a class on the Civil Rights Act as part of his Contracts class, told TechCrunch+ that a victory by Blum and the American Alliance for Equal Rights would stop many of the efforts designed to address the current disparities within venture capital.\nThe Civil Rights Act was the first piece of federal civil rights legislation passed in the U.S., enacted to guarantee that contracts would be honored regardless of race. At the time, it was widely held at the time that the market was open to everyone, but it wasn\u2019t really.\n\u201cFor years, Black founders have complained of discrimination, but they have been effectively blocked from doing anything about it, because, to prevail, they must show that the discrimination is intentional,\u201d he said, adding that many avoid doing so because it can be harmful to their careers. \u201cSo rather than challenging this head-on, one alternative tack has been to set up funds that specifically recruit Black or women founders. That effort is what is being challenged here.\u201d\nBlum told TechCrunch+ that the American Alliance for Equal Rights was contacted by a woman-owned business that asked to help challenge Fearless Fund. \u201cThe program being challenged is racially exclusive, thus violating our nation\u2019s civil rights laws. It is to be hoped that other programs like this one end these practices and offer the benefits to all small businesses regardless of the owner\u2019s race,\u201d he said.\nFearless Fund did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nFearless Fund was founded in 2019 with the sole purpose of backing entrepreneurs who are women of color. Just a few weeks ago, TechCrunch reported that the fund raised an undisclosed amount, with the goal to deploy at least $50 million as part of its second fund. It is also currently in the process of hosting one of its grant contests.\nBlum has a history of teaming up with individuals to sue race-based policies. For this latest suit, he told Reuters that the white and Asian American members of the American Alliance for Equal Rights were excluded from the grant because of race.\nRecently, he sued Harvard to overturn affirmative action, saying it discriminated against Asian Americans, and assisted a young white woman in suing the University of Texas over affirmative action, though he lost that last case.\nThomas Dorwart, a managing partner at law firm Thomas C. Dorwart Law, said the American Alliance for Equal Rights could have a chance to win, but not based on the UNC and Harvard affirmative action cases. That\u2019s because the court\u2019s ruling there applied only to government funding.\nThe Supreme Court \u201chas held that the statute cited by Blum applies to the employer-employee relationship. It could be argued that Fearless Fund is only an investor and is not an employer of the grantees. Thus, Blum\u2019s and SCOTUS\u2019 reasoning do not apply,\u201d Dorwart told TechCrunch+. \u201cFurther, SCOTUS, in the recent affirmative action decision, did not address military academies, and let stand that diversity may be considered by military academies. That same reasoning could apply in venture capital, especially considering the funding gap.\u201d\nStill, as Jomayra Herrera, an investor at Reach Capital, noted, this is an important reminder that venture capital is not immune to the broader political polarization that is happening across the country.\nMinority fund managers and founders are understandably nervous. According to Luke Cooper, the founder of Latimer Ventures, which focuses on backing founders from Black and Latinx communities, this suit would only make it harder for Black founders to receive funding. Grant programs such as the one Fearless Fund offers are often the only way such founders can access money.\n\u201cAn event like this is deeply concerning because it holds existential risk to the good work that many of us are doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will have the unintended consequence of shedding light on the tattered cordage of this industry\u2019s rigging.\u201d\nBrandon Brooks, a founding partner at Overlooked Ventures, called this a \u201cbullshit case\u201d but conceded that Blum was likely to win, especially after his success with toppling affirmative action in college admissions.\n\u201cAny funds or sub-funds based on diversity investing will have to shift focus; LPs will be scared to invest in those funds for fear of lawsuits,\u201d he added.\nIndeed, there is a new crop of diverse fund managers from overlooked backgrounds who are focused on funding their communities. \u201cThis case will certainly impact Black and even female-focused funds,\u201d Dorwart said. \u201cBut, again, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how it plays out, considering these are not employer-employee relationships. Perhaps the court will hold that any funds that receive funding from government entities or institutions are subject to the statute Blum cites.\u201d\nThe American Alliance for Equal Rights winning could result in more litigation overall against businesses, universities and government agencies\u2019 programs that target marginalized groups, Shill said. This could turn out to be detrimental to not only Black people, but also all people from underrepresented backgrounds.\nKate Tamera, a trans founder of gender-affirming health service Euphoria, stressed how much founders like her rely on grant programs since funding for trans people is almost nonexistent.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no concrete evidence to support the claim that majority founders are being denied equal opportunities when the existing system already disproportionately favors them at the expense of minority founders,\u201d she said.\nShill said that Blum\u2019s victory would also likely not have an impact on the funds that exclusively or disproportionately back white founders, explaining that funds that do this often do so subtly and implicitly, and the direction of the law in the last few years makes it very difficult to prevail on such a claim.\nInstead, it\u2019s likely that this grant contest would be shut down or retooled, and \u201cother efforts at remediating the effects of racism in this country will be more vulnerable legally,\u201d he said.\nBut even if Blum ends up winning, it doesn\u2019t mean that funding for Black founders has to stop. \u201cIf he wins, Fearless Fund\u2019s solution, in my view, is to still provide grants that benefit Black women, or Black founders in general, but to [also] provide some smaller percentage of grants to other races,\u201d Dowart said.\nHe also believes, though, that the same type of lawsuit has just as much of a chance as succeeding against the typical large VC funds \u201csince Black and women founders are at like less than 2% of funding,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey are being forced out of the market and discriminated against in the same way under the same statute.\u201d\nThis story was updated to add a quote by Thomas Dorwart and clarify the class Gregory Shill teaches, along with Blum\u2019s Harvard suit."

        "text": "Dan Gwak of Point72 Ventures on why defense tech is becoming the next big thing for investors\nDan Gwak has had a more varied life than many investors. He grew up in Jakarta, the son of Korean parents who ran a shipping business. After high school, he headed to Cornell in the U.S. and became an associate at The Carlyle Group.\nEverything was moving up and to the right, so to speak. Then, like a gut punch, the financial recession hit in 2008.\nGwak was among many who suddenly found themselves on uneven footing and evaluating their next steps. Unlike most of his young investing peers, Gwak quickly decided to join the U.S. Marine Corps as a machine gunner. It seemed like a natural decision, given that in Korea, where military service is compulsory for men between ages 18 and 35, both Gwak\u2019s father and brother had served. It was also Gwak\u2019s way of \u201cbecoming American,\u201d he says.\nWhile he wasn\u2019t expecting his service to end four years later in Afghanistan \u2014 he was wounded and sent home \u2014 Gwak again didn\u2019t waste much time deliberating about his next moves. He applied and was accepted to Harvard Business School, and nearly since that time, he has been investing at the intersection of national security and technology. Out of school, he joined In-Q-Tel, which is the venture arm of the CIA. In 2017, when the billionaire hedge fund manager \u201cStevie\u201d Cohen decided to build out a venture practice \u2014 Point72 Ventures \u2014 he poached Gwak, and Gwak has remained active since, including leading a 50-person team that has invested more than $1 billion into roughly 130 companies on Cohen\u2019s behalf.\nThe deals range across four key areas: deep tech, fintech, enterprise and defense tech. But in a lengthy conversation with Gwak earlier today, he talked the longest about defense tech as he\u2019s passionate about it and because the way he sees it, Washington is focused more than ever on the global balance of power \u2014 and looking for any edge it can find. Below are excerpts from that part of our chat, edited lightly for length and clarity. You can listen to the entire conversation here.\nTC: You have these four areas on which you\u2019re focused, but fintech has cooled off after several frothy years, and defense tech now seems top of mind for investors. Is that true inside Point72?\nDG: Absolutely. If you rewind the clock, fintech was an area that was very hot and we were very active in deploying a lot of capital. Today, the area that\u2019s really come up is defense tech. It\u2019s not just that the market in general has corrected, but rather, I think defense tech, specifically as an opportunity, has really [gained traction] among other venture investors, as well as founders [along with a growing] awareness of the importance of defense tech to the government.\nGiven your experience over the years, working for and selling to the government, does the sales process move any more quickly than historically? The long-standing knock, of course, is that it\u2019s too bureaucratic and there\u2019s too much red tape to get past.\nEven five years ago, I would have told you that defense tech investing the way that we think about it \u2014 which is investing in companies whose primary customer is going to be the Department of Defense \u2014 is a bad idea for exactly the reason that you describe. But that has changed for a couple of big reasons. First of all, the government is generally inefficient at buying things until something comes along that has the potential to shift the global superpower balance, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing today. If you look at the last time that happened, that was probably pursuing the atom bomb and the Manhattan Project. When you look at things like AI and all the ways it applies \u2014 whether that\u2019s autonomy or computer vision or natural language processing \u2014 these are all things that absolutely can shift the global superpower balance, and the government sees that now. And when the government sees that, then it becomes much, much better at buying things.\nIt seems like a portfolio company of yours, Shield AI, falls into this category. [Editor\u2019s note: Shield AI develops AI-powered fighter pilots and drones that it sells to the U.S. Air Force and U.S Army.]\nAutonomous drone swarms do have the ability to shift the global superpower balance, whoever gets that right and can release a drone swarm of thousands. That is an approach [against which there are] just not good defenses today, even if you own the largest aircraft carrier fleet in the universe. [And because a company like Shield AI can help in] the future preparedness of America, it can, as a result, get a lot of the funding that comes out of the government. It used to be because of the slower sales cycles and so forth, you had to kind of count on the prize being larger but taking longer to get to. [Today] we\u2019re finally entering a time where, as long as you align with something that really, really matters to the government and you can connect the dots effectively, you can grow that business as quickly as as any commercial business,\nWhat has Ukraine meant for its business?\nUkraine\u2019s impact on defense tech has been a very catalyzing one. Everyone understood even before Ukraine that drone swarms and the effective use of attributable technologies and things like that could have a very big impact. Ukraine just serves to highlight that in real life. When you look at what\u2019s going on there, that effective use of drones has had a massive impact in that battlefield.\nSo-called slaughterbots are autonomous drones that are programmed to kill people without any human intervention. How does a company like Shield AI deal with potential customers that might misuse its technology?\nI don\u2019t want to speak on the company\u2019s behalf on that topic because it is a conversation that the company should have with its customers, and I\u2019m not necessarily in those conversations. However, I think the overall topic \u2014 the danger posed by autonomy when it comes to taking human beings out of that decision to attack \u2014 is a very interesting one. To my mind, it\u2019s all about system design. Any weapon in the world that has a kinetic effect can be very, very dangerous \u2014 to the enemy, to ourselves, and to noncombatants who just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.That\u2019s why when you look at all these kinetic systems, there\u2019s always good system design around the decision to take an action, and a human being is usually in the loop. When it comes to this new wave of technology, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re throwing that concept of safety out the window. Good, sound, system design, as informed by the risks that we are willing to\u00a0 subject ourselves to, is always going to be an important part of the equation.\nThe U.S. government is a big customer that can demand that things are tailored for its purposes. Does it preclude these companies from selling to other governments? How does that work? Do they have to get buy-in from Washington?\nIt depends on what other country we\u2019re talking about [laughs]. To contextualize with numbers, though, the overall spending of the United States and all of its allies on defense is $1.6 trillion. That is a gigantic market. It is an order of magnitude larger than the commercial SaaS market. Of that 1.6 trillion, fully 50% of it is just the U.S. So when you see defense tech companies so focused on the U.S. defense market, there\u2019s a good sound reason for that. That [also] means that if that largest part of the market is asking you not to interact with nations that might be adversarial to the United States, you\u2019re going to respect that.\nAre the investors interested in these deals changing at all? I know who some of the players are \u2014 you, In-Q-Tel, Lux.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nLux is certainly one that\u2019s been investing where deep tech meets defense tech for a while. [There]\u2019s also Founders Fund, 8VC, a16z as part of their American dynamism effort. There is a core group of half a dozen or so that have been focused on defense tech for a while. Now I\u2019m seeing additional investors, tier one venture investors, who were not necessarily historically interested in defense tech, start to be a lot more interested. That\u2019s a good thing. The opportunity is just so large. If you think about it, the DoD has an $800 billion budget and only 1% of that today goes to startups.\nThat\u2019s an incredible stat. I guess I have the headline to this story now. Who gets the rest? Lockheed Martin?\nIt\u2019s largely the defense primes today, which serve an important purpose. But the truly transformational technologies that the DoD needs to be able to harness in the next 10 years, those are going to come from startups."

        "text": "Astra lays off 25% of workforce, reallocates engineers, in an effort to fight dwindling cash reserves\nAstra has laid off 25% of its workforce since the beginning of the quarter and is reallocating at least 50 engineers and manufacturing staff away from its launch business to focus on spacecraft production, the company said Friday.\nThe reallocation and layoffs are expected to delay testing of the under-development Rocket 4 and Launch System 2.0, Astra said. The affected employees worked in the company\u2019s launch, sales and administration and \u201cshared services\u201d departments. Workforce reductions are expected to save the company more than $4 million per quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of this year.\nAstra, which is facing dwindling cash reserves, is no doubt looking for a way to further reduce operating expenses while also bolstering its spacecraft engine business, the only business unit that currently has a near-term chance of generating revenue. The spacecraft engine technology is sourced from Astra\u2019s acquisition of propulsion developer Apollo Fusion, which closed the day Astra went public in July 2021.\nIndeed, Astra said that it had closed 278 committed orders of the Astra Spacecraft Engine product through\u00a0the end of March, which totals around $77 million in contracts once the engines are delivered. A \u201csubstantial majority\u201d of these orders will be delivered through the end of 2024, the company said.\n\u201cWe are intensely focused on delivering on our commitments to our customers, which includes ensuring we have sufficient resources and an adequate financial runway to execute on our near-term opportunities,\u201d Chris Kemp, CEO and founder, said in a statement.\nAstra also said that it had engaged investment bank PJT Partners as a financial advisor as it looks for more capital to continue operations. That includes \u201cpotential strategic investments in the Astra Spacecraft Engine business to strengthen Astra\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d the company said. Separately, Astra said it had raised $10.8 million in a debt sale to investment group High Trail Capital.\nAccording to preliminary second-quarter financial results, Astra is expected to have revenues between $0.5-$1 million, while having just $26-$26.5 million in cash on hand.\nThis is not the first time major layoffs have hit the space company. Last November, Astra announced it had let go of 16% of its employees, also to focus on launch and spacecraft engines."

        "text": "SoftBank sues IRL over \u2018elaborate scheme\u2019 that swallowed $150M\nSoftBank once invested in social app IRL at a $1.1 billion valuation. Now, the Japanese investment firm is suing the defunct company for fraud, alleging $150 million in damages.\nIRL was supposedly poised to become an event organizing alternative for Gen Z, who are using Facebook less and less. Its self-reported numbers were impressive enough to solicit a $170 million Series C led by SoftBank in 2021, but earlier this summer, an internal investigation by IRL\u2019s board of directors found that 95% of the app\u2019s users were fake.\nIn its legal complaint, SoftBank explains that it was moved to invest in IRL because of its impressive user numbers; the app claimed it had been downloaded by 25% of U.S. teens under 28 years old and was growing at a 400% year-over-year rate. But per the IRL board\u2019s investigation, none of these figures were accurate.\nInvestors don\u2019t always do their due diligence, but SoftBank claims it wouldn\u2019t have been possible to verify IRL\u2019s fake user numbers, since it had \u201cprepared for SoftBank\u2019s due diligence and structured IRL\u2019s business so that SoftBank could not discover evidence of their fraud.\u201d SoftBank explains in detail its attempts at conducting due diligence before forking over a nine-figure sum.\nPer SoftBank\u2019s claims, IRL was spending tens of thousands of dollars on proxy services to fraudulently inflate IRL\u2019s user data with bots. SoftBank also accused IRL of paying hundreds of thousands of dollars per month to a secret firm operated by IRL\u2019s head of Growth to cover up this scheme.\n\u201cBecause IRL did not have any profitable revenue stream, its value to an outside investor like SoftBank depended on its active user metrics as a source of potential future income,\u201d SoftBank\u2019s complaint reads. \u201cThus, SoftBank relied on the accuracy of representations from IRL\u2019s executives concerning both the quantity and quality of IRL\u2019s users.\u201d\nReached via text, IRL CEO Abraham Shafi did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment. Shafi is named as a defendant in the complaint, as are five of his siblings and cousins, who SoftBank alleges were part of this cover-up. Each of these family members sold IRL common stock to SoftBank in connection with these investments.\nWhen SoftBank accessed a third-party report on IRL\u2019s total users and downloads, the data said that by spring 2021, IRL had only been downloaded 9 million times. Shafi, on the other hand, was claiming that the app had 12 million monthly active users, and that 2 million events got planned each day on IRL. Shafi explained away this discrepancy by saying that the number accounted neither for web sessions, nor underage users, whose data could not be shared.\n\u201cIn reality, the platform was a virtual ghost town, filled with bots deceptively mimicking active human users,\u201d SoftBank wrote.\nIn addition to this lawsuit, IRL is being probed by the SEC to determine whether the app violated security laws by misleading investors.\n"

Syntellis became an independent company in 2020 with investment support from private equity firms Thoma Bravo and Madison Dearborn Partners.\nOver the past three years, the firms worked with Syntellis to grow the company\u2019s products and platforms business, most recently directing its acquisition of healthcare data analytics firm Stratasan. Syntellis formed a strategic alliance with Kaufman to serve as its enterprise performance management and data analytics provider of choice, and pursued customers not only in healthcare but also in higher education and the finance industry.\nThose specific customer segments aside, enterprise performance management is a profitable sector. According to a report from Allied Market Research, the global market for enterprise management software could be worth as much as $12.56 billion in 2025, up from $4.73 billion in 2016.\nA separate report from IDC found that in 2022, the enterprise performance management applications market grew 8.7%, with public cloud deployments growing by 26.5%. One of the coauthors, senior research analyst Roy Huo, posited\u00a0that the increased demand for capabilities like \u201cpredictive modeling, scenario planning, predictive forecasting, integrated planning, and external intelligence\u201d played a pivotal role.\nIn 2020, Syntellis claimed to have over 2,800 customers, with around 450,000 users relying on its data solutions.\n\u201cThoma Bravo and Madison Dearborn Partners\u2019 support and collaboration have propelled our growth, helped advance our product roadmap and enabled us to better serve our valued clients,\u201d Syntellis CEO Flint Brenton said in a canned statement. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a testament to the great work from the entire Syntellis team and marks an exciting new chapter for the company. As part of Roper, we will further our mission to empower our clients to optimize performance through our industry-specific, tailored solutions.\u201d\nRoper has an interesting history, dating back to 1890 primarily as a manufacturer of home appliances, pumps and other industrial products. It began broadening its business into software in the early \u201990s, after launching a corporate acquisition program supported by an IPO.\nAs of 2017, Roper \u2014 which has several main business lines, including core industrial tech, radio frequency tech, scientific and industrial imaging and energy systems and controls \u2014 had annual revenues of more than $1.23 billion."

        "text": "X\u2019s takeover of @music handle hints toward possible music plans\nX, the company formerly known as Twitter, appears to be hinting toward plans to move deeper into the music industry or collaborate with artists and labels with its recent takeover of the @music handle on the social network.\nThe account was originally operated by software developer Jeremy Vaught, who grew the @music handle to roughly half a million followers. Last week, Vaught posted in anger that X had commandeered the account for itself, 16 years after its 2007 creation.\n\u201cSuper pissed,\u201d Vaught wrote on X, sharing a screenshot of the email X had sent him informing him of the change.\n16 years ago, I created @music and have been running it ever since. Just now, Twitter / X just ripped it away.Super pissed pic.twitter.com/ctacWKY9js\n\u2014 Jeremy Vaught (@jeremyvaught) August 3, 2023\n\n\u201cThe user handle associated with account @Music will be affiliated with X Corp,\u201d X\u2019s email explained to Vaught. \u201cAccordingly, your user handle will be changed to a new user handle,\u201d it read. X also offered to transfer Vaught\u2019s data, including his followers and following lists to a new account of his choosing. At the time, that data had been moved over to @musicfan, but X made a few other suggestions, like @musicmusic, @music123, and @musiclover as potential possibilities.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that X has seized control of a user\u2019s account after Elon Musk renamed Twitter to X. However, it is the first time that it took over a user\u2019s account that\u2019s not obviously associated with the \u201cX\u201d branding.\nPrior to this, X had taken ownership of the @x handle from its operator, Gene X Hwang of the corporate photography and videography studio Orange Photography, saying it was the property of X Corp. The company thanked Hwang for his loyalty and offered him a selection of X merchandise and a tour of X\u2019s HQ, as a \u201creflection of our appreciation,\u201d in addition to moving his data to a new handle.\nX has also since renamed other Twitter accounts and products, like TweetDeck, which became XPro; Spaces, which became @XSpaces; Business, which became @XBusiness; plus various regional accounts and others. Even X CEO Linda Yaccarino became @lindayaX, post-rebranding.\nBut Twitter grabbing @music for itself is a suggestion that the company is thinking more seriously about how to become a home to artists and musicians. That\u2019s not a new idea for the social network, but one that failed the last time Twitter tried it.\nIn earlier years, Twitter launched a stand-alone music service with the debut of the #Music app. Launched in 2013, the app was the brainchild of We Are Hunted, a startup Twitter had quietly acquired the prior year. #Music, as the app was called, pulled in users\u2019 music from partners like Spotify and iTunes, then combined that with Twitter data from their following graph to make recommendations.\nDespite being one of the better implementations of social music discovery and recommendations at the time, Twitter shut down the app the following year.\nNow it appears the @twittermusic handle for this older app has had its data relocated to @music as X\u2019s newly acquired account has 11.5 million followers. (The creation date of September 2011 is still a mystery, however, as Vaught\u2019s account was founded in 2007 and the #Music app launched well before this date.)\nToday, @music\u2019s timeline includes tweets and retweets of musicians and their work, including links to YouTube videos. Though it\u2019s not yet clear what grander plan X has in store for @music, the fact that it felt the need to retake the account is likely tied in with the company\u2019s renewed ambitions as a place for creators to gain visibility and get paid for their work. Late last month, for instance, X opened up its revenue-sharing program with global creators, who now share in X\u2019s ad revenue.\nThe company also\u00a0began allowing subscribers\u00a0to upload two-hour videos\u00a0to its service, which advertiser Apple then leveraged when it\u00a0released the entire first episode\u00a0of its hit Apple TV+ show \u201cSilo\u201d on the platform. Fired Fox News host Tucker Carlson had been\u00a0posting lengthy videos to Twitter as well, until ordered to stop by the network. Could music videos be the next step?\nCreators sharing their music would be a natural progression for X\u2019s creator economy ambitions. Plus, collaborations with artists and musicians could see X going up against other social networks, like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok \u2014 the latter of which just announced a talent competition for aspiring artists in the hopes of bringing more indie musicians to its platform.\nMeanwhile, X competitor\u2019s Threads from Instagram is seemingly challenged in getting artists on board, a recent report by Music Ally noted. It found that the 20 most popular musicians on Instagram weren\u2019t yet using Threads. At the time of the report, 14 of the 20 have yet to set up their Threads profiles, including big names like Ariana Grande, Beyonc\u00e9, Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, Zendaya, Cardi B, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Drake, Billie Eilish, Lisa (from Blackpink), Dua Lipa and Snoop Dogg.\nX, meanwhile, is in the midst of making the social network into an \u201ceverything app\u201d that would encompass creators, payments, banking, and possibly stock trading \u2014 though Elon Musk denied the latter post-publication of that report. Instead, he\u2019s expressed his interest in transforming the micro-blogging network into a place where people could write longer posts of 25,000 characters, send money to one another, and even store their cash in high-yield accounts on X, in addition to discovering and supporting creators.\nPayments or even micro-payments could help fans to support the work of new and emerging indie artists as well, which is where @music could come in.\nOr, perhaps, X aims to work with labels to offer its platform for music promotions, get into streaming itself, or allow for the integration of music clips into creators\u2019 content. Or maybe all of the above!\nAs of yet, X hasn\u2019t yet telegraphed its intentions for X\u2019s new @music handle, but it\u2019s shaping up as one to watch."

        "text": "Cramorant is back, baby\nThe Pok\u00e9mon Presents livestream on Tuesday morning was pretty mid. We knew that the Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet & Violet DLC (downloadable content) was coming, and I still refuse to learn what Pok\u00e9mon Caf\u00e9 ReMix is, why they\u2019re turning Tatsugiri into sushi, and how to reconcile the ethics of eating Pok\u00e9mon in-universe. N64\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2 coming to Switch is nice, but the biggest surprise among today\u2019s load of announcements? Cramorant is back, baby.\nIn an anticipated announcement, the Pok\u00e9mon Company revealed that the first installment of the Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet & Violet DLC, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, will be released on September 13. As usual, the trailer for the expansion reveals some key plot points \u2014 in this upcoming installment, The Teal Mask, we\u2019ll journey to Kitakami, a mountain town that\u2019s hosting its annual festival. But more importantly, in a split-second clip from the trailer, we learn that Cramorant lives in Kitakami.\n\nCramorant was introduced in the previous main series Pok\u00e9mon games, Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield, and became a quick fan favorite because it\u2019s weird as hell. Based off a cormorant, Cramorant has a special ability called Gulp Missile, and to put it succinctly, this means that sometimes it tries to eat Pikachu. If you use surf or dive in battle with less than half of your Cramorant\u2019s HP, you will become the silliest Pok\u00e9mon in the game, and yes, that\u2019s including Dudunsparce.\nThe great literature of the Pok\u00e9dex entry reads as follows: \u201cThis Cramorant has accidentally gotten a Pikachu lodged in its gullet. Cramorant is choking a little, but it isn\u2019t really bothered.\u201d Cramorant\u2019s shiny variant is orange, which fans theorize is a reference to a not-super-anomalous occurrence in which seagulls fall into vats of curry.\nSo, naturally, some of us Pok\u00e9fans were gutted when Cramorant didn\u2019t seem to make the cut to appear in Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet & Violet. To add insult to injury, the Paldea region is based off the Iberian peninsula, a region that, according to a very quick Wikipedia search, does indeed have cormorants.\nThankfully, the Pok\u00e9mon Company has rectified its mistake. When The Teal Mask hits the Nintendo eShop on September 13, we will reunite with this absolutely bonkers bird. And maybe, just maybe, the game will finally allow us to change our clothes.\nI played a sneak peek of \u2018Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet,\u2019 the franchise\u2019s first open world game\n"

        "text": "WhatsApp introduces screen sharing during video calls\nWhatsApp today introduced screen sharing as its latest feature to enhance the video-calling experience on its platform \u2014 taking on traditional video conferencing apps, including Microsoft Meet, Google Meet, Zoom, and Apple\u2019s FaceTime.\nThe new feature, announced this morning by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg through a Facebook post and on his Instagram channel, will allow you to share your documents, photos, and even your shopping cart with contacts available on video calls.\nFirst released for some beta testers on Android in late May, screen sharing on WhatsApp can be accessed by tapping or clicking the \u201cShare\u201d icon. Users can choose between sharing a specific app or their entire screen. This is similar to how screen sharing works on typical video-conferencing platforms like Google Meet and Zoom.\nWhatsApp told TechCrunch that the screen-sharing feature has started rolling out on Android, iOS, and Windows Desktop in a phased manner. That means you may not see the feature immediately, but should soon.\nAlongside screen sharing, WhatsApp launched video-calling support in Landscape mode to offer a wider and more immersive viewing experience over the existing Portrait mode. Support for the Landscape mode may also be useful when using screen sharing on the platform.\nVideo calling has been a part of WhatsApp for over six years, as it debuted for all users on the platform in November 2016. However, the instant messaging app is gradually improving the service to stay relevant in the competition. Just recently, WhatsApp brought picture-in-picture support for video calls to iOS. It also enabled the option to share short video messages in chats, as video, in general, has been a crucial source of communication for many users.\nScreen sharing has been a crucial feature of video-conferencing apps for a while now, including those aimed at consumers. In 2021, for example, Apple enhanced its FaceTime service with SharePlay, which enabled iOS users to share their screens natively. WhatsApp has gone even further by extending this feature to users on Android, iOS, and desktop."

        "text": "Rubrik acquires Laminar to expand in data security across public clouds\nCybersecurity startups, in particular those hatched in Israel, have been getting scooped up at a rapid pace by larger tech companies looking to bolt on new capabilities to address business customers\u2019 growing security needs as they adopt new technologies themselves. In the latest development, Rubrik, a cloud data management company, is buying Laminar \u2014 a specialist in securing data run and stored across popular public cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, Google and Snowflake.\nFinancial terms of the deal have not been officially disclosed but one source puts the figure at \u201cnorth\u201d of $100 million, while two other sources say the total deal is actually closer to $200 to $250 million.\nRubrik is acquiring all of Laminar\u2019s assets with the deal: workers, tech and customer contracts.\u00a0Laminar has its roots in Tel Aviv (officially it is headquartered in the U.S.), and it will become the basis of a new cybersecurity R&D operation for Rubrik.\nIt is not clear how many employees will be coming over with the acquisition: I have heard chatter that some workers are getting let go ahead of the deal being made public and closing. Rubrik and Laminar declined to comment on those details.\nFor Rubrik, the deal, which should be finalized by the end of this year, helps it close the loop on the tools it provides to its customers. Initially these were built ten years ago and designed to cover backup and management but have, in the name of resilience, extended deeper into the more granular aspects of data security over the years.\n\u201cBackup, recovery and data protection have a lot of overlap with security, but the watershed moment was in 2018 when a customer had a ransomware attack,\u201d and that required more than just data recovery to fix, said Mike Tornincasa, chief business officer. He said that the business has been \u201ccompletely reoriented over the last five years\u201d to be increasingly about proactive security posture rather than simply data recovery. (Rubrik itself has had at least one big security run-in that could have also precipitated that move.)\nRubrik is privately held and VC-backed, but in June it was reported that it hired bankers to start the IPO process, notable given how few public listings we\u2019ve seen in recent times. It has more than 4,500 customers and an extensive list of investors, including Bain, Greylock, IVP, Khosla, Lightspeed, and a number of individuals. Rubrik\u2019s last equity round was in 2021, included Microsoft as a strategic backer, and came in at a $4 billion valuation. Rubrik declined to comment on its IPO plans today.\nLaminar launched in 2021 with some buzz, coming out of stealth with $37 million in funding to secure public cloud assets, right at a time when many companies, thanks to COVID-19, were undergoing \u201cdigital transformation\u201d and migrating work to public clouds, exposing a new and growing security risk in doing so.\nIts backers included the cybersecurity company SentinelOne, Salesforce Ventures, TLV Partners, Meron Capital, Tiger Global and Insight, the latter of which partnered with the company to help it identify potential customers by way of Insight Ignite, a sourcing and business intelligence platform covering Insight\u2019s wider portfolio.\nBut that Series A, which got extended a few months later to $67 million, turned out to be Laminar\u2019s last round. It was apparently looking to raise more, but with the funding landscape drying up, another option started to emerge: rumors earlier this year said the company was talking to a number of potential buyers, including Rubrik and Datadog, for a price up to $250 million.\nIt may have also been finding it a struggle to scale. Amit Shaked, the CEO who co-founded Laminar with Oran Avraham (CTO), said that its customers numbered in the \u201cdouble digits.\u201d He also confirmed that Laminar was indeed approached by multiple acquirers ahead of going with Rubrik; he said the company hadn\u2019t been looking for more funding.\nYears of easy-to-raise capital led to the proliferation of thousands of new startups; now as those startups struggle to raise further rounds to grow, it\u2019s created a very ripe market for M&A.\nTornincasa said that the Laminar acquisition came after an \u201cexhaustive search to find the best team and product\u201d in public cloud security posture management, and that Rubrik met with more than a dozen startups in the space. That says something too about the very competitive environment: Joining with Rubrik gives Laminar a competitive edge in terms of product development.\n\u201cThe moment I met with Mike and Bipul [Sinha, Rubrik\u2019s founder and CEO] I realized that we shared the same vision, and it made more sense to join them to move faster, rather than stay independent,\u201d said Shaked.\nThe gap in the market that Laminar aims to tackle is a persistent one for enterprises and other businesses that manage and use data in the cloud, and it boils down to the issue of visibility. In many cases, organizations are opting for hybrid solutions, where data might be kept across multiple silos in public clouds, private clouds, and on premises.\nAs apps, data, functionality, users, devices are all switched in and out across that organization\u2019s network, the ability to track how data is moving, who is using it, and inadvertent vulnerabilities all become harder to see and manage. Rubrik estimates that by 2025, the cost of cybercrime to business will be as high as $10 trillion, a threat \u2014 and, yes, an opportunity.\nLaminar is among a group of cybersecurity companies that have emerged to address that by providing both posture management and remediation tools to help security operations teams track activity and identify when something is amiss. While organizations can buy into these capabilities from a third party \u2014 indeed, that is what Laminar has offered to date, as have others like Symmetry Systems, Dig, Flow Security, Cyera and others \u2014 the logic here for Rubrik is that it\u2019s creating a one-stop shop for its customers, growing its revenue funnel, improving how it can work with customer data, and helping customers reduce the number of contracts they need to manage in the process.\nThe Tel Aviv cybersecurity R&D center will sit alongside other R&D operations in Bangalore, India and Palo Alto, California.\nOther recent deals in cybersecurity in Israel have included CrowdStrike buying Bionic.AI for between $200 million and $300 million; IBM buying Polar Security; and Palo Alto Networks buying Cider Security for up to $300 million, among a number of others."

Roughy 350 jobs will be eliminated, according to the people and an internal memo.\nMPL earlier declined to comment but following the publication of the story confirmed the layoff. The news about the layoff has not been previously reported.\n\u201cAs a digital company, our variable costs predominantly involve people, server and office infrastructure. Therefore, we must take steps to bring these expenses down in order to survive and to ensure that the business remains viable,\u201d Sai Srinivas, founder and chief executive of MPL, wrote to employees in email on Tuesday.\nThe move comes in the wake of New Delhi announcing a new taxation rule to the online gaming industry. India\u2019s Goods and Services Tax Council, which comprises top federal and state finance ministers, announced plans to levy a 28% indirect tax on online gaming, casinos and horse racing.\nThe new taxation rule increases tax burden on MPL by as much as 350% to 400%, Srinivas wrote in the email Tuesday.\nAll India Gaming Federation, which represents players, including Mobile Premier League, Gameskraft, Paytm First Games, Zupee, Nazara and Rush, labeled the new taxation rule \u201cunconstitutional, irrational, and egregious.\u201d Scores of top investors, including Tiger Global, DST Global, Peak XV, Steadview Capital and Kotak Private Equity subsequently wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to reconsider the \u201conerous tax regime.\u201d\nThe investors\u2019 group said the decision would lead to a write-off of $2.5 billion and a loss of 1 million direct and indirect jobs. However, the Indian government did not roll back its decision.\nShortly after the taxation changes were announced, MPL archrival and India\u2019s largest fantasy-gaming platform Dream11 cut its operating profit projections by 80% to below $100 million in the year ending March 31, 2024, from $350 to $400 million, Indian outlet The Arc reported.\nTo be sure, GST Council did introduce a measure to partially alleviate the industry\u2019s concerns last week by implementing taxation on the total deposits made for playing online games rather than taxing every individual bet. Additionally, the council has planned to reevaluate this decision within the next six months following the implementation of the tax, set to take effect on October 1.\nMPL, which counts Peak XV, Times Internet, MSA Novo, Crown Capital, Composite Capital and Moore Strategic Ventures among its investors, has raised $396 million to date, according to market intelligence platform Tracxn.\n\u201cWe have spent a lot of time evaluating and re-evaluating this decision; asking ourselves if we should wait or not. Eventually, we came to this conclusion because we believe that in uncertain times \u2014 the sooner we are able to deliver certainty to everyone, the better,\u201d Srinivas wrote to employees."

This platform will also be used for the upcoming Range Rover Evoque, Range Rover Velar, and Land Rover Discovery Sport \u2014 all small to mid-size sporty SUVs.\nThe Defender has long been Land Rover\u2019s explorer\u2019s SUV. The current model was introduced in 2020 and is a stark departure from the boxy original, with a sleek unibody design and an interior aimed at an up-market crowd. The upcoming EV Defender will likely follow the same cues while still emphasizing the go-anywhere, do-anything ethos of its predecessor.\nA smaller, less-expensive EV Defender would likely be a hit. It would follow the hot trend of modern, adventure-ready SUVs. The Ford Bronco is one of the automaker\u2019s most in-demand vehicles. Just last week, Toyota revealed an ultra-capable and less expensive Land Cruiser, which is only available with a hybrid power plant.

        "text": "Simon Data is putting customer data to work with $54M Series D\nThe customer data platform (CDP) has become a standard way to collect first-party customer data and put it to work. Simon Data, which was founded in 2015, has always had a vision of being more than purely a customer data repository. It also offers applications out of the box to work with that data, while giving customers the opportunity to build custom applications as they see fit.\nThe world has caught up with that vision. Every company is talking about building applications now, whether in machine learning models or through other applications. Investors are seeing those trends, too, and today the company announced a $54 million Series D.\nCompany co-founder and CEO Jason Davis says his company has always been focused on looking beyond the pure nuts and bolts of running a CDP and concentrating on what you do with that data once you have it.\n\u201cIf you were to reimagine what a CDP is outside of what a CDP has been historically with companies like Segment that have collected data and did all the plumbing, and instead reoriented a CDP so that your application allows business stakeholders and marketers to do stuff with data, what does the world look like? And that really has been where we\u2019ve been focused since the beginning,\u201d Davis told TechCrunch.\nThat has become even more important over the last several years, as companies want to do more than simply collect data, whether it\u2019s in a CDP or a data collection repository like Snowflake or Databricks. They want to put it to work. \u201cOur vision, and the product that we built today is truer to that vision than it ever has been before, has been to serve as the application layer that really unlocks confirmable first party data that brands have stored within their four walls, but marketers haven\u2019t been able to access at all,\u201d he said.\nAmong the applications available out of the box are audience management, email marketing and customer identification. Davis didn\u2019t want to share the number of customers using the platform, but mentioned some names like JetBlue, SeatGeek and Venmo to name a few.\nFor an eight-year-old company that has now raised over $100 million, it has kept the operation reasonably lean with around 100 employees today with plans to increase that by around 30% in the next year. At a time when investors are looking for efficiency over growth that should resonate. \u201cWe are making real investments around R&D and our ecosystem, and we\u2019re also on the path towards profitability and we\u2019re not going to be diverging from that materially,\u201d he said.\nWhen it comes to hiring, the company takes diversity and inclusion very seriously.\u201dI believe, fundamentally, first and foremost, that because we\u2019re solving such hard problems, we need to have folks who help build the business from different angles. We have to have folks who come from different backgrounds, and diversity is the key to everything,\u201d Davis said.\nHe is doing more than talk. The company has organized internal groups for women, people with neurodiversity, and so forth, and each one has a dedicated budget that goes toward awareness, inclusion, and educational initiatives. \u201cI think one of the big challenges about diversity is this lack of awareness that people really have around how it can really drive the business forward, and how it\u2019s not just best for everyone individually, but collectively as a business.\u201d\nThe company has an office in New York City, but like a lot of startups, it\u2019s a remote-first culture, he says.\nToday\u2019s $54 million Series D investment was led by Macquarie Capital with participation from existing investors Polaris, .406 Ventures and F-Prime. The company has now raised over $115 million, per Crunchbase data.\nSimon Data hauls in $30M Series C to continue building customer data platform\n"

        "text": "Greenlight\u2019s new credit card helps teens, their parents build credit together\nGreenlight Financial Technology has long provided financial education and debit cards to its child and teen customers since 2014; however, today the company launched the Greenlight Family Cash Mastercard to help those same customers build their credit before they reach adulthood.\nParents add their teens as authorized users of the Greenlight Family Cash Card, which is available with all Greenlight subscription plans, starting at $4.99 per month. Families can then earn up to 3% cash back on all purchases. The card is issued by First National Bank of Omaha.\nTeens can track their credit card balances on the Greenlight app while parents can set up flexible spending limits and get real-time purchase alerts. In addition, the company\u2019s in-app financial literacy game Level Up now includes credit lessons to aid teens as they use the card.\nTim Sheehan, co-founder and CEO at Greenlight, told TechCrunch that it\u2019s the 3% cash back, Level Up and parental controls that separate Greenlight from credit card rivals. He especially noted the educational component so that children and teens learn credit card concepts, including paying off the credit card each month to avoid compounding interest that can lead to debt and that an excellent credit score can help them save thousands of dollars when it comes time to buy a car or house.\n\u201cThere\u2019s some card programs where you can add an authorized user, but nobody has all three of these features,\u201d he said.\nThe Atlanta-based Greenlight is now working with over 6 million customers and has raised about $550 million in total venture-backed capital since its inception, Sheehan said. The most recent investment included a $260 million Series D round in 2021 that valued the company at $2.3 billion.\nThe credit card is the newest offering for the company, which last December introduced a free web-based financial literacy library aligned with the K-12 national standards for schools, teachers and students. Prior to that in October, it also added family safety features to its subscription plan called Greenlight Infinity, which is priced at $14.98 per month for the whole family.\nDespite the growth in its customer base, Greenlight hasn\u2019t been without challenges. In January, the company confirmed that it laid off around 21% of its employees, with Sheehan saying the decision at that time was a \u201cpreemptive move\u201d driven by the macroeconomic environment.\n\u201cThe good news is we continue to grow, and our retention rates have actually never been higher,\u201d he said. \u201c[To] me, the highest compliment our customers could give us is that in a difficult economy they still keep their Greenlight subscription. And now we are in a fortunate position where we don\u2019t need to take investment right now.\u201d\nUp next, the company\u2019s teacher\u2019s guide combined with Level Up, called Greenlight for Classrooms, was rolled out in Georgia and will go nationwide in the fall. Sheehan is also putting some focus on expanding Level Up\u2019s financial literacy content.\nCredit card and payments companies compete for a slice of the growing BNPL market\n"

        "text": "Catch+Release is building an AI-powered search engine to help brands license user-generated content\nCompanies seeking images or videos for their materials will typically commission a shoot, or scour stock media catalogs. Catch+Release, however, wants to help marketers license existing user-generated content, and the eight-year-old startup is setting out to build an AI-powered search engine to help brands do just that.\nCatch+Release \u2014 founded out of San Francisco by Analisa Goodin \u2014 has been in existence since 2015: first as an image research firm, and then as a platform for brands to find user-generated content for their various campaigns. The company raised $14 million in the Series A round of funding in 2021, and today it revealed that it has raised an $8 million extension round at the same (undisclosed) valuation. Existing backer Accel has returned to the fray, alongside Cervin and Stagwell, with new investors including HarbourVest Partners, Kevin Durant\u2019s venture firm 35V, and Gainsight CEO Nick Mehta.\nGoodin told TechCrunch that the company decided not to raise a Series B for now, due to the current economic environment.\nThe Catch+Release platform helps onboard marketers, giving them access to bookmarking tools to find suitable content. Brands can build their collections and galleries by pasting the URLs into Catch+Release, though the platform also offers human curation services for a fee.\nIf a company registers interest in a specific piece of content, Catch+Release examines it through various lenses; for example, to see whether there are any logos of other brands, how sensitive the content is, and the number of people in the image or the video. Then it assigns a \u201clicensability\u201d score to that content \u2014 something akin to the Zestimate score on Zillow.\nCatch+Release then approaches the creator with an offer and helps them understand the licensing process.\nOn the other end, Catch+Release proactively asks creators to join the platform and plug in their various social channels \u2014 such as TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube \u2014\u00a0 so brands can find their content more easily.\nThe startup charges brands a flat fee for clearance \u2014 a term used to formalize licensing from creators. It also charges a marketplace markup on the content after paying creators.\nGoodin said that the company has helped creators secure $20 million in licensing fees to date. However, the company is not yet profitable and is looking to invest its new cash injection into product and marketing.\n\u201cA creator could get paid anywhere between $1,000 and $3,000 for working with a big brand,\u201d Goodin said. \u201cHowever, that payout could be as low as $100 or $200 for licensing their content to a small brand.\u201d\nLooking to the future, Catch+Release is building an AI-powered search engine for brands, something that Goodin says currently doesn\u2019t exist for marketers.\n\u201cFor example, [let\u2019s say] I\u2019m a diaper company and I want to create a story that helps my consumers see that we care about our consumers,\u201d Goodin said. \u201cI can\u2019t go on Instagram and search something like \u2018heartwarming diaper moments.\u2019 So we are trying to solve these kinds of use cases.\u201d\nThere is a lot of chatter around the use and ethics of generative AI in the creative world. Goodin thinks that while brands require a lot of images and video assets, generative AI tools don\u2019t yet offer enough quality \u2014 especially in videos \u2014 to fulfill these needs. She added that Catch+Release customers are not currently thinking about using AI for their visual marketing campaigns.\nGoodin noted that the company has been approached for licensing its data for training generative AI work, adding that Catch+Release would \u201chappily participate\u201d in such a program as long as the data is being used fairly and creators are compensated.\u00a0 However, she didn\u2019t specify who approached the startup for AI training data."

        "text": "Flower lands $3.6M to grow its platform for federated learning\nThe reliance on public data \u2014 mostly web data \u2014 to train AI is holding back the AI field. That\u2019s according to Daniel Beutel, a tech entrepreneur and researcher at the University of Cambridge, who co-founded a startup, Flower, to solve what he sees as a growing problem in AI research.\n\u201cPublic, centralized data is only a tiny fraction of all the data in the world,\u201d Beutel told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cIn contrast, distributed data \u2014 the data that\u2019s trapped on devices like phones, wearables and internet of things devices or in organizational silos, such as business units within an enterprises \u2014 is much larger and more comprehensive, but out of reach for AI today.\u201d\nFlower, which Beutel co-started in 2020 with Cambridge colleagues Taner Topal and Nicholas Lane, the ex-head of Samsung\u2019s AI Center in Cambridge, is an attempt to \u201cdecentralize\u201d the AI training process through a platform that allows developers to train models on data spread across thousands of devices and locations. Relying on a technique called federated learning, Flower doesn\u2019t provide direct access to data, making it ostensibly \u201csafer\u201d to train on in situations where privacy or compliance are concerns.\n\u201cFlower believes that, once made easy and accessible because of the fundamental advantages of distributed data, this approach to AI will not only become mainstream, but also the norm for how AI training is performed,\u201d Beutel said.\nFederated learning isn\u2019t a new approach. First proposed in academia years ago, the technique entails training AI algorithms across decentralized devices holding data samples without exchanging those samples. A centralized server might be used to orchestrate the algorithm\u2019s training, or the orchestration might happen on a peer-to-peer basis. But in any case, local algorithms are trained on local data samples, and the weights \u2014 the algorithms\u2019 learnable components \u2014 are exchanged between them to generate a global model.\nStartups like DynamoFL, DataFleets and Sherpa are employing federated learning in some form to train AI models, as are Big Tech companies like Google.\n\u201cWith Flower, the data never needs to leave the source device or location (e.g., a company facility) during training,\u201d Beutel explains. \u201cInstead, \u2018compute goes to the data,\u2019 and partial training is performed at each location where the data resides \u2014 with only training results and not the data eventually being transmitted and merged with the results of all other locations.\u201d\nFlower recently launched FedGPT, a federated approach to training large language models (LLMs) comparable to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and GPT-4. Currently in preview, FedGPT lets companies train LLMs on data spread around the world and on different devices, including data centers and workstations.\n\u201cFedGPT is important because it allows organizations to build LLMs using internal, sensitive data without sharing them with an LLM provider,\u201d Beutel said. \u201cCompanies also often have data spread around the world, or in different parts of the organization, that are unable to move or leave a geographic region. FedGPT lets all of this data be leveraged when training an LLM while still respecting concerns over privacy and data leakage, and laws restricting data movement.\u201d\nFlower is also partnering with Brave, the open source web browser, to spearhead a project called Dandelion. The goal is to build an open source, federated learning system spanning the over 50 million Brave browser clients in use today, Beutel says.\n\u201cAI is entering a time of increasing regulation and special care over the provenance of the data it uses,\u201d Beutel said. \u201cCustomers can build AI systems using Flower where user privacy is strongly protected, and yet they are still able to leverage more data than they ever could before. .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0Under Flower, due to federated learning principles, an AI system can still successfully be deployed and trained under different constraints.\u201d\nFlower\u2019s seen impressive uptake over the past several months, with its community of developers growing to just over 2,300, according to Beutel. He claims that \u201cdozens\u201d of Fortune 500 companies and academic institutions are Flower users, including Porsche, Bosch, Samsung, Banking Circle, Nokia, Stanford, Oxford, MIT and Harvard.\nBuoyed by those metrics, Flower \u2014 a member of one of Y Combinator\u2019s 2023 cohorts \u2014 has attracted investors like First Spark Ventures, Hugging Face CEO Clem Delangue, Factorial Capital, Betaworks, and Pioneer Fund. In its pre-seed round, the startup raised $3.6 million.\nBeutel says that the round will be put toward expanding Flower\u2019s core team, growing its team of researchers and developers and accelerating the development of the open source software that powers Flower\u2019s framework and ecosystem.\n\u201cAI is facing a crisis of reproducibility, and this is even more acute for federated learning,\u201d Beutel said. \u201cDue to the lack of widespread training on distributed data, we lack a critical mass of open source software implementations of popular approaches. . . . By everyone working together, we aim to have the world\u2019s largest set of open source federated techniques available on Flower for the community.\u201d"

        "text": "Chargeflow, which taps AI to fight chargebacks, raises $14M\nChargeflow, a startup using AI to fight chargeback fraud, today announced that it raised $11 million in a seed round led by the VC firm OpenView Venture Partners. The tranche builds on Chargeflow\u2019s previously undisclosed $3 million seed round closed several months ago, bringing the startup\u2019s total raised to $14 million.\nChargeflow was launched in 2021 by Ariel Chen and his brother Avia Chen, both Israeli-American entrepreneurs. They previously co-founded Babe Cosmetics, a beauty brand developing a line of skincare products, which they sold to focus on Chargeflow.\n\u201cAlthough Babe Cosmetics was thriving, it encountered a significant problem with chargebacks,\u201d Ariel and Avia told TechCrunch via email. \u201cThis glaring issue, coupled with our expertise in ecommerce, tech and fintech, ignited our determination to find a solution \u2014 but we couldn\u2019t find an existing one.\u201d\nSo Ariel and Avia started Chargeflow, which taps machine learning to generate custom \u201cdispute evidence\u201d \u2014 e.g. delivery confirmation receipts, signed orders and so on \u2014 for each chargeback and automatically submit it to the corresponding bank or credit card company.\nChargebacks are more complex than you might think. Credit card networks use different chargeback codes, and each code requires different evidence to overturn a chargeback.\nAny barrier to overturning fraudulent chargebacks costs businesses time \u2014 and money. According to a 2022 survey, 65% of merchants reported an increase in chargeback fraud from the year prior. Merchants lose an estimated $34 for every $1 in chargebacks, and this figure is expected to increase to $193 in 2023.\nTo maximize the chances of a merchant win, Chargeflow matches incoming disputes to a business\u2019 order data, checks the code and its associated requirements and generates a dispute response using custom-made templates. Human experts review the AI-generated responses before they\u2019re submitted.\n\u201cOn average, it takes about one to two man hours of labor to fight a single chargeback,\u201d Ariel and Avia said. \u201cChargeflow automates and eliminates the need for manual chargeback dispute and reduces that labor cost to zero.\u201d\nIntegrating with existing e-commerce platforms, payment service providers and other, related tools, Chargeflow calculates the projected success of chargeback disputes by comparing transaction data, only billing merchants based on successful recovery of disputes in their favor.\nChargeflow claims to have thousands of customers. But there\u2019s an abundance of vendors in the chargeback-fighting space \u2014 see Chargehound (which PayPal acquired in 2021), Justt, Midigator and Equifax-owned Kount, to name a few.\nBut Ariel and Avia didn\u2019t express much concern about Chargeflow\u2019s growth prospects.\n\u201cChargeflow is well positioned to help merchants and business mitigate the problem and ensure higher business margins while reducing overhead expenses,\u201d they said. \u201cDespite the economic slowdown in other tech sectors, Chargeflow is growing rapidly.\u201d\nThe proceeds from Chargeflow\u2019s latest raise will be put toward enhancing its tech development efforts and strengthening its growth trajectory in the U.S., Ariel and Avia said. They\u2019ll also support Chargeflow\u2019s hiring efforts; the company\u2019s looking to double its roughly 40-person headcount to 80 by the end of the year."

We had to assess the extent of the incident to understand who might be impacted and liaise with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO). We also needed to put additional security measures in place to prevent any similar attacks from taking place in the future,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nThese measures include strengthening its network login requirements, improving its threat monitoring capabilities and updating its firewall policies, according to an FAQ published by the Electoral Commission.\nThe Electoral Commission\u2019s spokesperson told TechCrunch that the incident, which saw hackers access the Commission\u2019s email, control systems, and copies of the electoral registers, may have affected as many as 40 million U.K. voters. This includes anyone who registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, as well as the names of those registered as overseas voters.\nWhile the Electoral Commission has been unable to ascertain whether the attackers exfiltrated data held on its systems, it says that data potentially impacted includes U.K. citizens\u2019 full names, email addresses, home addresses, phone numbers, any personal images sent to the Commission, and any details provided via email or online contact forms.\nThe watchdog notes that while much of this information is already in the public domain, it could be combined with other data to infer patterns of behavior or to identify and profile individuals.\nThe Electoral Commission added that there has been \u201cno impact\u201d on the security of U.K. elections.\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s democratic process is significantly dispersed and key aspects of it remain based on paper documentation and counting,\u201d the Commission states. \u201cThis means it would be very hard to use a cyberattack to influence the process.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not yet known who was behind the attack. The Electoral Commission said \u201cwe do not know who is responsible for the attack,\u201d and the NCSC declined to answer when asked by TechCrunch.\n\u201cWe provided the Electoral Commission with expert advice and support to aid their recovery after a cyber incident was first identified,\u201d the NCSC spokesperson said, who declined to provide their name. \u201cDefending the UK\u2019s democratic processes is a priority for the NCSC and we provide a range of guidance to help strengthen the cyber resilience of our electoral systems.\u201d\nWhen reached for comment, ICO spokesperson James Huyton confirmed the Electoral Commission notified the data protection agency of the breach, but declined to say why there was a nine-month delay in public disclosure.\nDo you work at the Electoral Commission?

According to Crunchbase, VC financing for security declined to just over $1.6 billion in Q2 2023, marking a 63% drop compared to the same quarter last year \u2014 when startups landed nearly $4.3 billion.\nBut that\u2019s not to suggest deals have dried up entirely.\nEnter Horizon3, a startup providing a platform designed to improve the effectiveness of organizations\u2019 cybersecurity solutions. Horizon3 today announced that it raised $40 million in a Series C round led by Craft Ventures with participation from Signal Fire. Bringing the company\u2019s total raised to $78.5 million, the round will be put toward R&D, expanding Horizon\u2019s channel presence and growing its team of engineers, CEO Snehal Antani says.\nHorizon3 was founded in 2019 by a team of former U.S. Special Ops cyber operators, entrepreneurs and cybersecurity practitioners including Antani. Previously, Antani was the CTO at Splunk and a team leader within the U.S. Military\u2019s Joint Special Operations Command, which studies special operations requirements and techniques.\nAccording to Antani, Horizon3\u2019s founding team sought to build a solution that could solve the common security problems faced by enterprise organizations, namely the ineffective security tools, false positives and lead times in hiring consultants for security assessments and manual testing.\n\u201cOur thesis is using the attacker\u2019s perspective to cut through the noise and help organizations find and fix exploitable attack vectors,\u201d Antani told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cWe deliver this by enabling continuous, autonomous testing and other operations to identify proven attack paths and weaknesses in our users\u2019 networks. We aim to deliver the best-in-class autonomous security risk management platform that provides accurate risk insights and actionable recommendations for technical users, decision-makers and auditors.\u201d\nHorizon3\u2019s software attempts to continuously find, fix and verify exploitable attack surfaces by revealing attack paths, showing how possible weaknesses might impact the organization, prioritize and detail fixes teams should make and verify that those fixes are effective.\nThe platform has hundreds of exploit modules that can find and \u201csafely\u201d exploit specific weaknesses in networks, Antani explained. IT teams can use these modules to proactively fix security issues within their infrastructure, while security teams can tap them to tune third-party security tools, assess software supply chain risks and gain strategic insights.\nThe platform \u2014 a self-service software-as-a-service solution in the truest sense \u2014 requires no additional hardware or software to maintain.\n\u201cOn its own, Horizon3 pivots through a user\u2019s network, chaining weaknesses together just as an attacker would \u2014 and then safely exploits them,\u201d he added. \u201cThe platform uncovers blind spots in organizations\u2019 security posture that go beyond known exploits and patchable vulnerabilities, such as easily compromised credentials, exposed data, misconfigurations, poor security controls and weak policies. Weaknesses are prioritized based on their impact to the organization so users know immediately what they should fix first \u2014 and guidance on how to do it most efficiently.\u201d\nHorizon3 competes against Strike Security, Cobalt.io and HackerOne among others in a penetration testing tool market that could be worth as much as $2.7 billion in 2027, according to Markets and Markets.\nAntani asserts that Horizon3 has seen great uptake, though, with a customer base that recently eclipsed 300 organizations, including several government agencies. He anticipates that as more regulatory actions take place and new security guidelines and recommendations that support autonomous penetration testing approach, the demand for Horizon3\u2019s solutions will grow.\n\u201cSince the cyber threat landscape continues to expand, so will Horizon3\u2019s revenue and customer base grow as well,\u201d Antani said. \u201cOrganizations are beginning to reconsider legacy approaches to security assessments and\npenetration testing, and instead, are adopting autonomous pentesting at a considerable rate.\u201d"

In the first half of the year, China exported 2.34 million vehicles, according to customs data. The tally surpassed that of Japan, which finished H1 with 2.02 million cars exported.\nThis is the first time China has overtaken Japan in automobile export at the half-year mark. The achievement has been fueled by the \u201cexplosive growth\u201d of electric vehicle export, Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, wrote in a blog.\nIndeed, Chinese EV brands have been pushing aggressively overseas, venturing into not only emerging markets but also Western markets where competition is rife.\nXpeng and Nio, two young Chinese EV makers, kicked off their international expansion in Europe. BYD, the battery and hybrid vehicle-making giant, is establishing a footprint for its consumer vehicles in virtually every fast-growing market and major economy except the U.S. for now. Zeekr, the EV subsidiary under China\u2019s biggest private automaker Geely, has announced plans for Western Europe and Central Asia, with signs to test the water in the U.S. as well.\nEVs have emerged as a key area where China wishes to establish itself as a global leader, thanks largely to the country\u2019s dominance over the long and complex battery supply chain. To that end, the government has handed out generous subsidies and policy support to grow the sector, leading to competitively priced and quality plug-in vehicles, akin to what Japanese gasoline cars are famous for.\nAs one EV consultant told me recently: \u201cThere are only two types of EV companies in the world: Tesla, or Chinese EV makers.\u201d\nThe question, then, is whether Chinese passenger vehicles will be able to establish brand recognition away from home, especially in competitive Western markets.\nChinese EVs have yet to succeed in Europe; the Middle East could be different\n"

The EC points to Figma as the \u201cclear market leader\u201d for interactive product design tools, noting that there is unlikely to be any other \u201ccredible\u201d players entering the market post-acquisition. And while Adobe leads on digital asset creation tools, Figma currently serves as a \u201cconstraining influence\u201d over Adobe. Thus, buying Figma may prevent Figma from continuing its role as an \u201ceffective competitor.\u201d\n\u201cAdobe and Figma are two leading providers of software for the creative community in the digital sphere,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, the EC\u2019s executive vice-president for competition policy, in a statement. \u201cMany users and businesses rely on their digital design tools to excel in their work. With our in-depth investigation we aim to ensure that users continue to have access to a wide pool of digital creative tools among which to choose.\u201d\nIn truth, the transaction didn\u2019t actually meet the turnover thresholds set out in the EU merger regulations, meaning that the duo weren\u2019t required to notify European regulators. However, Article 22 of the regulations contains provisions that allow individual EU member countries to refer cases to the EC if they believe a transaction will reduce competition in their own market. And that is what happened here, with more than a dozen constituents referring the acquisition to the EC.\nWhile Europe does have a fairly robust track record of late in terms of investigating Big Tech acquisitions, it has also shown that it\u2019s reluctant to block deals outright. In the past few months it has greenlighted Microsoft\u2019s $68.7 billion Activision acquisition and Broadcom\u2019s $61 billion VMware bid, albeit with strict caveats and oversight stipulations in place.\nSo, all is not lost yet for Adobe, but it will likely have to make some kind of assurances and compromises if it wants to get the deal over the line.\nThe Commission said it plans to make a decision by December 14, 2023 \u2014 roughly one month after the outcome of its investigation into Amazon\u2019s $1.7 billion iRobot acquisition will be announced."

This addition meant Paramount+ subscriber count now stands at around 61 million \u2014 up from the 60 million reported last quarter.\nThe new integrated $11.99 per month plan with Showtime replaced Paramount+\u2019s premium ad-free $9.99 per month plan. At the same time, Paramount also raised prices for its Essential ad-supported plan from $4.99 to $5.99 per month. The company noted that combined viewing hours for Paramount+ and ad-supported streaming TV service Pluto TV jumped by 35% globally.\nParamount Global reported a total revenue of $1.67 billion for its direct-to-consumer service with streaming contributing $1.23 billion and advertising fetching more than $400 million.\nThe company\u2019s CEO and President Bob Bakish talked about Paramount\u2019s global expansion plans including Pluto TV\u2019s launch in Australia last week with 50 FAST channels.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just announced that we\u2019re expanding the global Pluto TV footprint with our launch in Australia. And we\u2019ll be launching ad-supported tiers of Paramount+ in certain international markets as we move forward. Importantly, the strength of our proposition is not just digital,\u201d he said\nThe company also noted that Pluto TV is now available in 35 markets across the globe.\nIn June, Paramount pulled a slew of content including shows like \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d and a bunch of Nickelodeon\u2019s animated shows.\nDuring Paramount Global\u2019s Q2 2023 latest earnings call, the company also said that it is selling the Simon & Schuster publishing house to KKR for $1.62 billion. The company put up the publication for sale first in 2020. It had agreed to a $2.2 billion deal with Penguin Random House, but the merger was blocked by a U.S. District Court after the Justice Department\u2019s complaint.

Stripping out shared assets, SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund 1 and 2 and its Latin American fund together posted a quarterly investment loss of 13 billion yen ($91 million) \u2014 significantly less than the 2,919 billion yen loss a year ago ($20 billion).\nCumulatively, the company said that investments across the three funds, as of June 30 total a $6.3 billion loss. Overall, SoftBank Group posted a net loss of 477.6 billion yen ($3.3 billion) \u2014 a surprise, as investment analysts were widely expecting a return to profitability this quarter.\n\u201cWe are carefully and slowly moving back to investment activities,\u201d CFO Yoshimitsu Goto said in the presentation today, adding that it would \u201ckeep focusing on the AI trend.\u201d\nThe company said that its total commitments across the Vision Funds 1 and 2 and its LatAm fund is $166.2 billion. It calculated its acquisition costs as $146.6 billion, and fair value of the assets currently as $140.3 billion.\nSoftBank said that its Vision Fund 1 and 2 respectively had quarterly losses of 38.749 billion yen and 46.860 billion yen, while the LatAm fund had a gain of 47.496 billion and other investments 25.070 billion on \u2018other investments. The Latin American business had a boost largely from the sale of Pismo, one of SoftBank\u2019s portfolio companies, to Visa for $1 billion in June.\nFurther dragged down by share price declines in holdings in Alibaba, Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile US, SoftBank\u2019s overall total loss on investments in the quarter was 699 billion yen (approaching $4.9 billion).\nSoftBank has made significantly more headway in activity from its first, older Vision Fund. The company said that of the 94 investments it made out of the nearly $90 billion fund, \u201cfair value\u201d is split between some $37.5 billion in private companies, $20.5 billion in public companies, and $44.2 billion in exits. Fair value from its $108 billion Vision Fund 2 stands at just $32.2 billion.\nVF2 is still young and will be taking a lead in investments going forward, he said.\nSoftBank added that some 94% of its portfolio companies from across all of its funds currently have a cash runway of more than 12 months.\nWe\u2019re listening to the presentation to hear what SoftBank has to say about Arm and its AI investments and will update this post with more.\nLast week, the company\u2019s Japanese subsidiary, also called SoftBank and overseeing its domestic business, launched a new business called SB Intuitions, which will build a Large Language Model and generative AI services focused specifically on Japanese and Japan\u2019s businesses and consumers. In July, the company also made a big investment into Symbotic \u2014 an AI-based warehouse logistics and robotics company, along with a joint venture to build services for third parties.\n"

The Seoul-based proptech outfit previously raised a total of $34 million, including\u00a0a $21 million Series A round it announced last year. Dongnae expects to close the transaction by the end of September. The company\u2019s investors include the likes of NFX, Daol Investment, Hana Financial, MetaProp, Maple VC and WeWork co-founder Miguel McKelvey.\nDongnae\u2019s primary product, Dongnae FLEX, offers a furnished apartment rental on its platform with flexible lease terms for as short a period as four weeks and lower rental deposits.\nThe addition of Dears will allow the company to upgrade the Dongnae FLEX service, manage properties \u201cwith a collective AUM of over $400 million,\u201d and span 90 apartment complexes across Seoul and Pangyo, where a host of tech firms, including Kakao and Naver, are located. Dears Pangyo has more than 520 studio flat units in Pangyo.\nThe outfit also will co-manage the Dears Myeongdong\u00a0building in Seoul alongside\u00a0Xi S&D. Dongnae will manage commercial spaces of Dears Myeongdong, consisting of B1, 14F and the rooftop, co-founder and CEO Matthew Shampine said, adding that Xi S&D will operate Dears Myungdong\u2019s 112 units that offer both short- and long-term stays.\nDongnae says this is its first acquisition. The current leadership team at Stevens will join Dongnae to support expansion and continue to build on their progress to date, Shampine told TechCrunch.\n\u201cWe are in active discussions with a number of landlords and land developers to open more buildings to be operated as and through Dongnae,\u201d Shampine said.\nFormer WeWork executives Shampine and Insong Kim co-founded Dongnae in 2020 to digitize South Korea\u2019s fragmented real estate market. In South Korea, people have to work with dozens of brokers to find a new home, and there are two options to pay rent in the country: paying a monthly fee (just like in many parts of the world) and paying everything in advance, called Jeonse.\n\u201cSince our Series A in March of 2022, we have been focused on growing our real estate portfolio, getting customer feedback, and building the necessary front- and back-end technology to truly create a better way to rent homes in Korea,\u201d Shampine said.\nThe company has invested \u201cheavily\u201d in enhancing the customer experience since last year. The outfit says it has digitized the entire procedure instead of the typical long, paper-filed leasing process and launched its own digital real estate consultant Suzie by integrating artificial intelligence into its platform. Like a chatbot, Suzie answers prospective residents\u2019 questions about housing or Dongnae\u2019s units in any spoken language.\n\u201cFrom Adam Neumann\u2019s Flow and companies such as Mint House, Zeus Living, and Blueground in America to Asian and European startups like Cove and Habyt \u2014 there has been great innovation in the residential rental market around the world over the past few years,\u201d Shampine said in a statement. \u201cOur team is committed to bringing about a better way to rent here in Korea.\u201d\nDongnae\u2019s application is now available for download on Android and iOS.\nFlexible, shorter-term apartment startups gain more traction\n"

        "text": "China\u2019s draft measures demand \u2018individual consent\u2019 for facial recognition use\nThe pervasive use of facial recognition technology across all facets of life in China has elicited both praise for its convenience and backlash around privacy concerns. The widespread adoption has also fueled the exponential growth of valuations in companies specializing in the field, such as AI giants SenseTime and Megvii.\nNow the industry is facing some potentially significant changes as Beijing steps up efforts to establish more defined boundaries for the technology\u2019s usage. The move is building upon the implementation of major tech regulations that rolled out in recent years targeting cybersecurity, data security, and privacy protection.\nOn Tuesday, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the nation\u2019s top internet watchdog, unveiled a series of proposed measures aimed at regulating the application of facial recognition. The technology has been extensively employed in both the public and private sectors, ranging from facial scans used to authenticate payments in supermarkets to identity verification procedures at airport boarding gates \u2014 the latter an increasingly common practice not only in China but also across the U.S.\nCritics have raised concerns over privacy and bias over the use of facial recognition. They complain that some residential compounds have made facial scans the only way of accessing buildings. There are also concerns about the accuracy and fairness of algorithms, particularly in recognizing the faces of minorities, which could lead to the unjust targeting of certain groups.\nThe proposed measures appear to provide individuals with more rights to opt out of facial recognition in specific circumstances \u2014 but they come with limitations.\nThe utilization of facial recognition should be limited to \u201cspecific purposes and full necessity,\u201d requiring individual approval or written consent, according to the draft measures.\nThe rules emphasize the need for clear signage in public areas where facial recognition is employed. Venues such as hotels, airports, and museums are prohibited from coercing individuals into accepting facial scans for such reasons as \u201cbusiness operations\u201d or \u201cservice enhancements\u201d. Moreover, facial recognition should not serve as the sole means of access to a building.\nWhen it comes to collecting facial biometric data from individuals under the age of 14, the consent of their parents or legal guardians must be obtained.\nOrganizations and individuals will bear higher operational costs for using the technology. Entities in possession of facial data on more than 10,000 individuals must register with a local branch of the CAC. The filing needs to explain the purpose of collecting such data and plans for data protection. Unless authorized by individuals, collectors are prohibited from retaining facial images in their original resolution.\nThe proposed measures, If effectively enforced, hold the potential to enhance security within an industry that has been relatively loosely regulated so far and lower the risk of data mishandling. China has seen several major biometric data breaches in recent years, compromising the sensitive information of millions of people.\nThe country has also drawn fire for deploying facial recognition systems to identify people\u2019s ethnicities, particularly in the case of Uyghurs; but that won\u2019t change with the new rules. According to the proposed measures, any organization or individual should refrain from utilizing facial recognition technology to create profiles based on race, ethnic group, religion, health, social class, or other sensitive information, unless it\u2019s deemed necessary for reasons including national security and public security.\nThe proposal is seeking public opinions until September 7.\nChina Roundup: facial recognition lawsuit and cashless payments for foreigners\n"

        "text": "Meatable sinks its teeth into $35M to accelerate launch of its cultivated pork products\nVenture capital funding to the cultivated meat industry has largely followed other industries in fewer investments made this year; however, there\u2019s still movement in this sector yet.\nHere in the United States, cultivated meat companies saw regulatory doors open widely after the Food and Drug Administration cleared Upside Foods and Good Meat in June to sell their cultivated chicken products across the country, and now both are in restaurants. In that same month, Omeat came out of stealth with its technology for making beef.\nEurope is heating up as well. Just last week, Israel-based Aleph Farms submitted an application in the United Kingdom to sell its cultivated beef steaks under the Aleph Cuts brand in that country. This followed Aleph\u2019s application submitted July 26 for regulatory approval in Switzerland. Meanwhile, U.K.-based Uncommon, formerly known as Higher Steaks, which also makes a wide assortment of cultivated meats, grabbed $30 million in Series A funding.\nNow Meatable, based in The Netherlands, is adding to that excitement with the announcement of $35 million of its own new financing. The company, initially making pork products, has now raised $95 million in total funding.\nBill Gates wants Western countries to eat \u2018synthetic meat\u2019; Meatable has raised $47 million to make it\n\nAgronomics led the new investment and was joined by new investor Invest-NL, which contributed $17 million, according to the company. Existing investors coming back include BlueYard, Bridford, MilkyWay, DSM Venturing and Wise chairman and founder Taavet Hinrikus.\nAnthony Chow, co-founder of Agronomics, was blunt during an interview when he said that it\u2019s \u201cthe worst possible time you could want to raise money,\u201d and that there has been a \u201creal drought of announcements\u201d in the cultivated meat sector, and that many of the more recent announcements, Omeat included, were for investments made \u201csome time ago.\u201d\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, this [Meatable\u2019s] is the only material financing that has been completed probably for 18 months, maybe even 24 months, of any meaningful size,\u201d Chow said.\nTechCrunch has followed Meatable since it picked up $10 million in funding back in 2019. At that time, the company was in its infancy, but had already unveiled its technology which takes animal cells without hurting the animal and then replicates the natural growth process of the cells using its patented \u201copti-ox\u201d technology combined with pluripotent stem cells, which have the ability to continuously and rapidly multiple. Typically, the cultivated meat process uses precision fermentation technology and bioreactors to make meat.\nSince its inception five years ago, the company has grown to a team of 100, started production in Singapore and held the first external tastings of its pork products after The Netherlands gave the green light for companies to organize tastings, Meatable\u2019s co-founder and CEO Krijn de Nood told TechCrunch. Oh, and raised $47 million.\nMore recently, de Nood unveiled the company\u2019s ability to slash production time it takes to make fat and muscle, from three weeks to eight days, telling AgFunder in May that while rivals are achieving 50-liter bioreactors, Meatable is currently able to reach 500-liter bioreactors and grow cells at 80 million cells per milliliter, thus enabling the company to make fat and muscle within days.\nFaster production also helps narrow the gap in production costs, which has been the bane of the cultivated meat industry for years and why we haven\u2019t seen a lot of it on grocery shelves yet.\nMeanwhile, the new funding will help Meatable, which is still pre-revenue, scale its processes and accelerate the commercialization of its first products, which will include sausages and pork dumplings, in Singapore starting in 2024, de Nood said. The company also plans to establish a presence in the United States in two years.\n\u201cTo build a profitable factory, you will need to put in $50 million to $60 million at least, probably a little bit more,\u201d de Nood said. \u201cWe really want to make sure that we spend the capital wisely and first focus on scalability and cost reduction. Then in the next 18 to 24 months start building that large scale.\u201d\nEditor\u2019s note: Aug. 8, 5:17 a.m. Edited to better explain Meatable\u2019s cultivated meat-making technology.\nInvestors salivate over food tech companies perfecting precision fermentation\n"

        "text": "Authors are losing their patience with AI, part 349235\nOn Monday morning, numerous writers woke up to learn that their books had been uploaded and scanned into a massive dataset without their consent. A project of cloud word processor Shaxpir, Prosecraft compiled over 27,000 books, comparing, ranking and analyzing them based on the \u201cvividness\u201d of their language. Many authors \u2014 including Young Adult powerhouse Maureen Johnson and \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere\u201d author Celeste Ng \u2014 spoke out against Prosecraft for training a model on their books without consent. Even books published less than a month ago had already been uploaded.\nAfter a day full of righteous online backlash, Prosecraft creator Benji Smith took down the website, which had existed since 2017.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent thousands of hours working on this project, cleaning up and annotating text, organizing and tweaking things,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cBut in the meantime, \u2018AI\u2019 became a thing. And the arrival of AI on the scene has been tainted by early use-cases that allow anyone to create zero-effort impersonations of artists, cutting those creators out of their own creative process.\u201d\nhttps://twitter.com/maureenjohnson/status/1688550493239255040\nSmith\u2019s Prosecraft was not a generative AI tool, but authors worried it could become one, since he had amassed a dataset of a quarter billion words from published books, which he found by crawling the internet.\nProsecraft would show two paragraphs from a book, one that was \u201cmost passive\u201d and one that was \u201cmost vivid.\u201d It then placed the books into percentile rankings based on how vivid, how long or how passive it was.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a writer as a career it\u2019s maddening, in part because style is not the same as writing a fucking whitepaper for a business that needs to be in active voice or whatever,\u201d author Ilana Masad said. \u201cStyle is style!\u201d\nSmith did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but he elaborated on his intentions in his blog post.\n\u201cSince I was only publishing summary statistics, and small snippets from the text of those books, I believed I was honoring the spirit of the Fair Use doctrine, which doesn\u2019t require the consent of the original author,\u201d Smith wrote. Some authors noted that the excerpts of their books on Prosecraft included major spoilers, causing further frustration.\nThough Smith apologized, authors remain exasperated. For artists and writers, the recent proliferation of AI tools has created a deeply frustrating game of whack-a-mole. As soon as they opt out of one database, they find that their work has been used to train another AI model, and so on.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much the norm, from what I can tell, for these sites and projects to do whatever they\u2019re doing first and then hope that no one notices and then disappear or get defensive when they inevitably do,\u201d Masad said.\nGenerative AI and the technology behind self-publishing have created a perfect storm for scammy activities. Amazon has been flooded with low-quality, AI-generated travel guides, and even AI-generated children\u2019s books. But tools like ChatGPT are basically trained on the sum total of the internet, so this means that real travel writers or children\u2019s books authors could be getting inadvertently plagiarized.\nAuthor Jane Friedman wrote in a recent blog post \u2014 titled \u201cI\u2019d Rather See My Books Get Pirated Than This\u201d \u2014 that she is being impersonated on Amazon, where someone is selling books under her name that appear to be written with an AI.\nThough Friedman was successful in getting these fake books removed from her Goodreads page, but Amazon initially told her it wouldn\u2019t remove the books for sale unless she had a trademark for her name.\nAfter Friedman\u2019s post went viral, Amazon removed the misleading books.\nAmazon spokesperson Ashley Vanicek told TechCrunch: \u201cWe have clear content guidelines governing which books can be listed for sale and promptly investigate any book when a concern is raised. We welcome author feedback and work directly with authors to address any issues they raise and where we have made an error, we correct it. We invest heavily to provide a trustworthy shopping experience and protect customers and authors from misuse of our service.\u201d\nThough both Prosecraft and Amazon ended up capitulating to writers\u2019 requests, there are many other cases in which writers\u2019 concerns aren\u2019t heard \u2014 disputes over the use of AI are one reason why Hollywood writers are currently striking, for example.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any writer is seriously convinced that AI is going to ruin books because like, well, that\u2019s not how literature works, and everything I\u2019ve seen ChatGPT write as a \u2018story\u2019 is just really fucking boring with no voice or real craft or style,\u201d Masad said.\nBut she worries that publishers will be convinced otherwise, and possibly replace marketing and publicity teams with AI-generated promotional content.\n\u201cIt feels really bad,\u201d she said.\nUpdate, 8/8/23, 9:30 PM ET: Added comment from Amazon Spokesperson.\nAI can\u2019t replace human writers\n\nScience fiction publishers are being flooded with AI-generated stories\n"

GM didn\u2019t give a precise date of when Mexico-based customers can begin ordering its products, only to say it would happen later this year.\n\u201cBringing BrightDrop\u2019s products to Mexico is a key move in our mission to decarbonize delivery globally, while helping customers take advantage of the economic benefits of going electric,\u201d BrightDrop\u2019s chief commercial officer Steve Hornyak, said in a statement.\nThe commercial EV business unit \u2014 an ecosystem of electric and connected products and software services that launched in January 2021 \u2014 is part of GM\u2019s strategy to dominate the EV industry. While it is still a nascent business, BrightDrop has managed to carve out some market share in the commercial EV fleet industry, gaining orders from DHL Express, FedEx and Ryder, among others.\nThe company expanded its business to Canada in late 2022 with the first Canadian-bound EV vans delivered in June of this year.\nProduction of Zevo 600 is ramping up with the smaller Zevo 400 on track to begin in the next few months, the company said. To date, more than 1,000 Zevo 600 vans have been produced at GM\u2019s CAMI Assembly plant in Ontario, Canada. The Zevo 400 will also be produced at the CAMI factory, which is expected to reach 50,000 vans annually by 2025."

        "text": "Lucid plans to start production of Gravity electric SUV in late 2024\nLucid said Monday it will reveal its long-awaited, all-electric Gravity SUV in November with production not kicking off until late 2024.\nThe EV maker, which has experienced a drop in sales for its well-regarded but pricey luxury sedan, had originally planned to begin producing the Gravity at its factory in Arizona in late 2023. That date was later pushed to 2024, but the company never indicated in which quarter production would begin.\nLucid gave consumers their first peek at the Gravity back in 2020 during an event to unveil the Air. At the time, the company said the Gravity was already well into the design process. Lucid even had a working prototype, which was spotted in summer 2020 out in the wild.\nThat progress seemed to stagnate as Lucid grappled with production of the Air sedan. Lucid provided its first real update in April 2023 when it began testing pre-production versions of the Gravity SUV on public roads.\nLucid has not yet shared the price of its upcoming Gravity SUV, but the automaker might feel pressure to hit a lower price point than originally planned. Over the weekend, Lucid reduced the price of its Air Pure sedan by $5,000 to $82,400, and dropped prices of the Air Touring and Grand Touring versions by $12,400 to $95,000 and $125,600, respectively.\nLucid shared the Gravity production date in its second-quarter earnings report, which missed Wall Street expectations. The U.S. automaker said it generated $150.9 million in the second quarter, a 55% uptick from the $97.3 million in the same year-ago period. That still wasn\u2019t enough to beat analysts expectations, which had forecast revenue of $175 million, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nLast month, Lucid said it delivered 1,404 Air sedans in the second quarter. While that was double the number of EVs it delivered in Q2 2022, it was still about 600 fewer than analysts had expected, pushing shares lower. It was also flat from the first quarter of 2023. Lucid delivered 1,406 vehicles in the first quarter of 2023.\nThe company reported a net loss of $764.2 million in the second quarter compared to a loss of $220.4 million in the same year-ago period. On a diluted basis, the company\u2019s net loss in Q2 2022 was $555.3 million.\nLucid reported a free cash flow of negative $904 million. However, the automaker confirmed that it raised $3 billion in capital in the second quarter, including $1.8 billion from Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF. Lucid reported liquidity of $6.25 billion, which Lucid CFO Sherry House says can take the automaker through the start of production for the Lucid Gravity, and into 2025.\nLucid\u2019s 2023 outlook remained the same, more or less. In February, the company halved its previous 2023 target from 20,000 to 22,000 vehicles to 10,000 to 14,000 vehicles. On Monday, Lucid said it is on track to deliver \u201cmore than 10,000 vehicles\u201d this year.\nLucid\u2019s stock climbed 4.5% in after-hours trading immediately after the company reported earnings.\nEV maker Lucid misses on revenue, earnings in Q1\n"

        "text": "Can Mill\u2019s tech-heavy food waste bin find its way into kitchens?\nFeeding table scraps to chickens isn\u2019t a new idea. But then again, neither were smoke detectors when Matt Rogers co-founded Nest in 2010, and that worked out pretty well.\nRogers is back at it, this time with fellow Nest alumnus Harry Tannenbaum. The duo and their team at Mill have cooked up what is probably the world\u2019s heaviest, most expensive, and most sophisticated kitchen waste bin.\nMill\u2019s aim is to eliminate carbon emissions that result from the decomposition of food waste. The startup isn\u2019t the first company to tackle the problem, but it does have a unique approach. Where most other companies focus on large sources like grocery stores or restaurants, Mill is for people\u2019s homes. Its bin grinds and dehydrates food, which the company then collects via the U.S. Postal Service and sells to farmers as chicken feed. As circular economy companies go, this one is pretty clever.\nMill sent me one a few months ago to test, and I proceeded to fill it with table scraps, melon rinds, corn cobs, and whatever else was on the extensive list of food waste it said it could devour. I wanted to see if the Mill bin could find its way into our daily routine while reducing the climate impact of our waste stream.\nThe short answer: It mostly did, with some notable hiccups.\nThe bin itself and any consumables are free, included in the subscription ($396 annually or $45 monthly, though the monthly plan tacks on a $75 fee to deliver the bin). Boxes and return shipping for the grounds are also included.\nMill\u2019s bin looks like a very nicely designed kitchen waste bin. The sides are a matte white, the foot pedal that operates the lid is gray, and the lid itself sports a faux blond wood finish with some clever shy tech hidden underneath (more on that later). A button on the lid serves to activate or deactivate the kid/pet lock. At the base of the back, there\u2019s a large hidden charcoal filter.\nStepping on the pedal activates a servo that flips open the lid. The actual interior is smaller than the outside suggests. A hefty metal bucket sits within, and inside the bucket is a set of augers that grind the food waste to bits. The setup looks kind of like a giant bread machine.\nAt the end of each day, the bin weighs any new additions and gets to work. The start time is set via a well-designed companion app. It also asks you to name the bin (I named ours \u201cMunchie\u201d). Our kitchen doesn\u2019t have any room near an outlet for the bin, so it sat around the corner in the family room. Since that\u2019s where we watch TV, I set it to start grinding at 10:30 p.m.\nOnce that time arrives, the bin locks with a sudden (and pretty loud) click of a solenoid and grinding commences. Depending on what you\u2019ve scraped in, the process can be relatively quiet or the bin can creak and groan like a 17th-century Spanish galleon. At some point, a heater and fan turn on to dehydrate the scraps.\nYou can keep track of progress in the app or by observing the lights that shine through the faux wood top. It\u2019s a clever bit of tech that tells you when the lid is locked, when the augers are grinding, or when the heaters are drying the grounds.\nUnder ideal conditions, the whole process is done by the time you\u2019re up for breakfast. In most cases, I\u2019d say that\u2019s true. You can open the app at any time to get an estimate for how long the grinding and drying process will last. Usually, it\u2019s accurate. Sometimes, it\u2019s not.\nOne night, I think I pushed the bin to its limits. With it nearly full of grounds, I added apple peels, an apple core, egg shells, table scraps, and an entire cantaloupe that had been hiding a surprisingly rotten smell inside its rind. I had chopped up the melon as the app suggested. At 10:30 p.m., I was told it would take seven to nine hours to complete the cycle. At 7:30 a.m. the next day, it said it would take another hour and three-quarters. At noon, its estimate hadn\u2019t changed. By 3:30 p.m., the estimate ticked up to 2:10 remaining. Finally, it finished at 6 p.m., 19.5 hours after starting.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time it had underestimated the time required. Not the end of the world since you can double-click the button on the lid to cancel the cycle and add more scraps, but it does mean that the fan was running literally night and day. It\u2019s not loud, but it\u2019s not quiet, either.\nWhen the bin is full, it\u2019ll send you a notification on your phone. To empty, just pop the lid, pull the handle to heave the bucket out of the bin, and dump the grounds into the supplied plastic bag. The grounds are shelf stable. Ours actually smelled pretty good, I thought, kind of like soy sauce. When the bag is full, toss it in an included prelabeled box. The boxes even have adhesive on the flaps so you don\u2019t have to tape it yourself. (For some reason, I really appreciated that.) When ready, just tell the app and it arranges for the USPS to pick it up the next day. I put the box on the front porch in the morning, and our mail carrier picked it up that afternoon.\nGenerally, the process was pretty smooth, with one notable exception. I woke up on Father\u2019s Day morning to a light flashing on the lid. The augers were jammed, though the cause wasn\u2019t immediately obvious. Feeling a bit lazy, I left the bucket in the bin and poked around for about 20 minutes trying to free things up. No luck.\nThe next morning, I followed the app\u2019s instructions and removed the bucket and dumped the loose grounds into the mail bag. At first glance, I noticed some of the grounds had been baked into the side of the bucket. I assumed this was the cause and chipped away at it with some disposable chopsticks. After a while, my father-in-law suggested that the jam might have something to do with small strands of fiber that had become wrapped around the augers, so I pulled as much off as I could. After 20 minutes of chipping and yanking, the augers were free once more.\nFollowing the jam, Mill told me that there were a few potential causes. Fibrous material had been causing people more problems than expected, so the team had updated the app\u2019s guidance on what should and shouldn\u2019t go in the bin. Corn husks were removed from the approved list, for example (something we hadn\u2019t added). Adding high sugar content scraps to a nearly full bin was also causing jams. (That full cantaloupe might have been to blame.) Lastly, the company has been refining the software that controls cycle time and temperature, cutting an hour of cycle time on average.\n\u201cRight now, we err on the conservative side to ensure there are no smells or potential for bacteria,\u201d Mill\u2019s Suzy Sammons told me. \u201cAs we get more data from customers and our field trials, that software gets better and better at predicting minimum length of cycle time and how much heat we need in the bin, and that reduces the likelihood of a jam.\u201d She added that the company monitors the bins remotely, reaching out to customers with jammed bins to help them troubleshoot it, and that software updates have reduced the likelihood of a jam by at least half. Plus, if any of the modular parts are broken, Mill will send a new one for free.\nMill said that early data suggests that people are getting comfortable with using the bins. Almost all the company\u2019s users had used the bin more than twice a day. In a pilot with the city of Tacoma, Washington, more than half of survey respondents said they hadn\u2019t previously used the city\u2019s curbside organics service, meaning they were likely sending food waste to the landfill.\nCurbside composting is probably Mill\u2019s most direct competitor. Some cities offer it free alongside waste and recycling collection while others charge a nominal fee, usually about $10 or $20 per month. That\u2019s significantly less than Mill charges, though the startup is working with municipalities to partially or fully subsidize the cost of the bin subscription.\nIn day-to-day use, I found the Mill bin to be both easier and more challenging to use than curbside composting. On the plus side, the Mill bin went weeks before needing to be emptied, and when I did, the grounds didn\u2019t have any foul odors. Our compost bin, which lives under the sink, needs to be emptied every few days, and opening it is always an olfactory adventure. On the minus side, the Mill bin jammed, something our \u201cdumb\u201d compost bin never does, and Mill\u2019s list of \u201capproved\u201d waste is more nuanced than with most composting services. The app makes it easy to check, but it\u2019s not often that people turn to apps before throwing something away.\nAnother thing that stood out was the fact that the Mill bin needs a power supply. That means you can\u2019t stash it just anywhere in your kitchen. Our garbage and recycling bins live in a slide-out drawer, so our kitchen layout doesn\u2019t have a natural place for another large waste bin. That meant the Mill bin went just around the corner, into the family room. The bin\u2019s sleek design meant it didn\u2019t stand out or draw disapproving glances, but when cycles went long, the fan did get a bit tiresome. Overall, the power requirement is neither good nor bad \u2014 different homes will have different layouts, and it may or may not be an issue for you.\nCan Mill find its way into enough homes to keep a significant amount of food waste out of landfills? Much will depend on bringing the cost down to the point where it\u2019s either free or competitive with existing curbside compost services. The power and space requirements may give some people pause, and the list of what can and can\u2019t go into the bin can be mentally taxing at first. But there are a lot of things that are right, and Mill\u2019s ability to update the bin\u2019s software gives it the flexibility to keep at it until things are closer to perfect.\nIs this another billion-dollar, environmentally friendly product on the order of Nest? It\u2019s still a bit early to tell, but for the climate\u2019s sake, I hope so.\nCorrection: Mill\u2019s annual subscription plan costs $396, not $495 as originally stated."

        "text": "Boeing\u2019s Starliner crew capsule will not be ready fly crew until March 2024\nBoeing and NASA managers are now estimating that the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft will not be ready to fly astronauts until March 2024, one of the longest delays yet to hit this already very delayed space program.\nBoeing\u2019s Starliner capsule is part of NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew program (CCP), one of two spacecraft \u2013 the other being SpaceX\u2019s Dragon \u2013 the space agency selected in 2014 to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. But while SpaceX\u2019s Dragon has been conducting many astronaut ferrying missions, Boeing\u2019s Starliner has been continually sidelined due to technical issues. To date, Starliner has completed just one un-crewed orbital test flight, which successfully launched last May.\nA crewed Starliner mission with two NASA astronauts aboard was due to launch in April, until it was delayed to July; then the two firms announced at the beginning of June that the crewed test mission would be postponed yet again, this time due to issues with the capsule\u2019s parachutes and the glass cloth tape that wraps around wire harnesses in the spacecraft.\nSteve Stich, a manager with NASA\u2019s CCP, told reporters Monday that the team has made a \u201ctremendous amount of progress\u201d since the June update. That progress includes redesigning the parachute \u201csoft links,\u201d or the connectors that attach the parachute to the capsule, and removing a \u201csubstantial amount\u201d of the P-213 glass cloth tape had been removed from the crew module. 85% of the tape has been remediated in the upper dome of the craft already, he added.\nBut even as NASA and Boeing make headway on these problems, they\u2019re proving to be very time-intensive. Mark Nappi, Boeing\u2019s Starliner program manager, said that the new parachute would not be delivered until around the beginning of December, with a drop test occurring in mid- to late-November.\nThat means the spacecraft won\u2019t be ready until early March \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean that the test mission will occur in early March.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now working with NASA Commercial Crew Program, ISS, and [launch provider] ULA on potential launch dates based on our readiness,\u201d Stich said. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated manifesto on ISS and the launch pad of ULA, so we\u2019ll work that throughout the next several weeks and see where we can get that in and we\u2019ll set a launch date.\u201d\nIn spite of this late schedule, NASA and Boeing managers affirmed their confidence that Starliner will be able to fulfill all of the contracted missions under the CCP before the ISS decommissioning in 2030.\n\u201cThere\u2019s really no reason to change our plans,\u201d Nappi said. \u201cWe\u2019ve bought hardware for six flights plus [the crewed test flight]. It still fits us well in the window that we have. There\u2019s additional flights are available outside of those six with other customers. So I think we are still committed, like we have been in the past, and will continue on.\u201d\nIn the meantime, costs continue to mount. Boeing has incurred nearly $900 million in losses due to delays in Starliner development as of October last year; no doubt that number will continue to climb until the capsule\u2019s maiden commercial flight."

        "text": "Scientists repeat breakthrough fusion experiment, netting more power than before\nIt wasn\u2019t a fluke: Researchers at a Department of Energy (DOE) lab have repeated their breakthrough fusion power experiment. Only this time, the results are even better.\nOn July 30, lasers once again converged on a tiny gold cylinder containing a diamond-coated, deuterium-tritium fuel pellet. When the beams \u2014 as many as 192 of them \u2014 hit the inside of the cylinder, their energy was turned into X-rays. Those X-rays then bombarded the fuel pellet, forcing it to implode.\nLast time, the resulting nuclear fusion reaction released 3.15 megajoules of energy. This time, it produced more than 3.5 megajoules, according to the Financial Times. That reportedly exceeds the amount of energy the lasers imparted on the hohlraum, as the cylinder is called, though it\u2019s unclear by how much.\nThe lab confirmed the successful repetition of the experiment and said it intends to report the details at either a scientific conference or in a peer-reviewed publication (likely both).\nWhile the most recent experiment won\u2019t garner quite as many headlines as the one in December, it\u2019s just as important. A breakthrough is meaningless if it can\u2019t be replicated. The fact that scientists have achieved net-positive fusion power twice should hearten investors, who bet over $4 billion on the industry in 2021 and 2022.\nPerhaps most encouraging is the fact that the July 30 shot didn\u2019t simply repeat the December results \u2014 it improved on them. We still don\u2019t know what the scientists did to better their numbers, but the bump in energy-out suggests that the new results are not a fluke. Scientists are probably getting better at understanding the quirks of inertial confinement fusion.\nInertial confinement, the type of fusion studied at the DOE\u2019s National Ignition Facility (NIF), is one of a few approaches that physicists and engineers are taking to fusion power. In it, lasers do the work of compressing and confining the fuel to create conditions that are ripe for atomic nuclei to fuse and release tremendous amounts of energy.\nThe other main approach is magnetic confinement. Most magnetic confinement experiments use powerful superconducting magnets to corral the fiery plasma, but there are a few other ways to compress fuel to a fusion-ready state.\nMost investors have gravitated to some form of magnetic confinement, in part because the hurdles to generating grid-scale power with inertial confinement aren\u2019t insignificant. Magnetic confinement faces high hurdles, too, but inertial confinement is particularly challenging.\nCommercial-scale inertial confinement power plants would have to fire on several hohlraums per second. The NIF experiments light up at most once per day. That\u2019s in part due to the enormous amounts of energy the lasers require (the most powerful in the world!). But it\u2019s also because each intricate, 1-centimeter-long hohlraum takes about two weeks to manufacture, and each diamond-coated fuel pellet can take months to produce.\nBecause the lasers require so much power to fire, the hurdle to net-positive power is that much higher to surmount. Yes, explosions at the NIF can generate more power than the lasers delivered to the fuel pellet, but the electricity demands of the entire facility far outstrip what those little blasts have generated so far. The world\u2019s most successful inertial confinement experiment remains about an order of magnitude away from being commercially viable.\nStill, the fact that the NIF was able to bump the output of the experiment suggests that they\u2019re not simply performing pure science experiments anymore. The underlying theory is sound; the scientists now have to generate more power by optimizing their experiments. That\u2019s starting to sound more like an engineering challenge, which is a lot easier than proving your underlying assumptions constitute valid physics.\nDoes it move up the fusion timeline, currently about a decade or so away from grid-scale power? Probably not. But it does give us a lot more confidence that we\u2019re on the right path."

        "text": "Chinese luxury EV brand Zeekr continues global push into Kazakhstan\nZeekr, the luxury electric vehicle brand under China\u2019s Geely Automobile Holdings, says it will launch its Zeekr 001 shooting brake and Zeekr X SUV in Kazakhstan by the fourth quarter of 2023.\nKazakhstan, a key market in Central Asia, marks Zeekr\u2019s third geographic expansion announcement in recent months. The two-year-old Chinese automaker also said it plans to begin selling vehicles in Europe and Israel by the end of 2023.\nThe aggressive push into new markets is fueled by the $750 million Series A funding round Zeekr raised in February, which shot the automaker\u2019s post-money valuation up to $13 billion. Prior to that raise, Zeekr said it had filed confidentially for an initial public offering in the U.S. and was reportedly seeking over $1 billion in proceeds.\nThe funds from Zeekr\u2019s Series A were dedicated to technology research and market expansion. At the start of the year, Zeekr posted 3,000 open positions in more than 30 cities around the world. The company has said it wants to expand to most Western European countries by 2026.\nA look at Zeekr\u2019s most recent job postings hints that the automaker is now also setting its sights on the United States, according to a job listing posted this weekend for a U.S.-based regulatory, policy and compliance manager who will support Zeekr\u2019s U.S. aftermarket efforts. The company did not respond in time to TechCrunch\u2019s request for more information.\nZeekr has sold over 100,000 vehicles, predominantly in China, since its launch in 2021. The young automaker has been successful in China in part due to its direct-to-consumer business model, which the company aims to bring to all its new markets. In Kazakhstan, Zeekr\u2019s local partner Orbis Auto, an automotive distributor, will facilitate the development of a sales network and after-sales service in the region. The pre-sale will begin in September with delivery to customers slated for November.\nZeekr hasn\u2019t shared at what price point it will sell the Zeekr 001 and X in Kazakhstan. In the Netherlands and Sweden, Zeekr\u2019s first European markets, the flagship 001 is selling for around $65,000, and the X for around $50,000.\nBoth of Zeekr\u2019s international vehicle offerings compete directly with Tesla\u2019s Model Y crossover. The 001 can deliver a range of around 375 miles, and the X has a range of almost 350 miles. Both vehicles include over-the-air software updates."

        "text": "Triller\u2019s upcoming listing likely won\u2019t resurrect the US IPO market\nShort-form video platform Triller filed to go public last week while your humble scribe was on vacation to visit family. The lesson? Never take time off.\nA privately backed tech company going public on the U.S. markets is welcome news. Sadly, while Triller is an interesting business, it may prove too small an offering to fully unlock the domestic IPO market for technology companies. Still, as with the Cava listing, a strong showing could further thaw the IPO market for private companies.\nThe Exchange explores startups, markets and money.\nRead it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.\nTriller\u2019s IPO is also interesting because it provides some nuance on the social video boom and the costs of content. However, because this company adopts a multipart approach to its market and has made several acquisitions, any comparisons to its chief competitor TikTok will prove limiting.\nSo, let\u2019s dig into the company\u2019s S-1 filing to find out how it\u2019s faring and what\u2019s in store in the months to come.\nTo work!\nTriller\u2019s S-1 filing is heavy on AI chatter. Calling itself a \u201cglobal, artificial intelligence powered technology platform,\u201d the app sits between creators, brands and their respective audiences. The company says it focuses on short-form video, \u201csimilar to TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube shorts\u201d and other related services.\nTriller also has loftier aspirations, saying it wants to \u201crebalance the equation\u201d between creators and platforms, expand the total market for created content, and provide creators with a larger slice of the pie.\nThe company also appears serious about artificial intelligence, with the S-1 filing clearly stating: \u201cOur proprietary AI and machine learning technology [helps creators] easily mix, edit and distribute music and video content to virtually any digital platform and enables them to understand and engage with their audiences at scale, while retaining control and authenticity.\u201d\nWhen it comes to encapsulating what\u2019s happening in tech right now, that\u2019s spot on.\nTikTok has been praised widely for its algorithms\u2019 effectiveness in helping users discover new material pertinent to their interests and so sends users to creators of all kinds. The model works, at least as far as the product is concerned. But Triller is more than just a short-form video app. It has bought a number of other companies in recent years to add services like music battles and mindshare (Verzuz), SMS-based creator-fan communication (Amplify.ai), fighting-related content (BKFC), and a SaaS service to connect brands and creators (Julius) to its business mix.\nTriller settles lawsuit with Timbaland and Swizz Beatz\n\nThe Julius acquisition is of particular interest, as Triller has historically earned a vast majority of its revenue from brands. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, for example, brands accounted for 100%, 97% and 82% of the company\u2019s total revenue, respectively. You can clearly see in the declining share of brands\u2019 contribution to the pie that the company is trying to diversify its sources of revenue, but it still has a lot of work left to do.\nBut how much revenue is Triller bringing in? And what does it cost to pay creators in the manner it aspires to?\nHere\u2019s the core dataset:\nFor a company that\u2019s going public, Triller boasts of pretty high revenue growth numbers: In the quarter ended March 31, the company\u2019s revenue rose just under 52% from a year earlier \u2014 that\u2019s akin to what some startups tend to report.\nHowever, much of Triller\u2019s recent growth came from acquisitions. In the quarter ended March, revenue gains were \u201cprimarily attributable to the acquisitions of BKFC and Julius, which contributed revenue was $2.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively,\u201d the company said. Without those purchases, this growth story would look much more modest. Indeed, the company\u2019s slower pace of creator and brand acquisition may indicate that the core Triller app is struggling to gain market share (data on pages 14, 135 and 136 of the S-1 filing contain more detail).\nTurning to profitability, if you compare Triller\u2019s topline with its cost of revenue, we can see that it is not generating much gross margin to fund its own operations.\nThis is partially due to how creator costs are accounted for. As the company writes (emphasis ours):\nCost of revenue is comprised of fees paid to Creators, performance and agency contracts, including media rights costs, as well as other license and royalty fees paid to third parties, hosting infrastructure and data center operations, personnel-related expenses for our customer implementation teams and contractors, including salaries and other related costs, service fees paid to third parties, and costs to host physical events, including staffing, materials and merchandise for sale.\nTriller\u2019s goal of paying creators more for their work does not come cheap, even if it does appear more equitable prima facie than what we see with other companies.\nStill, the company is making serious progress in the gross margin department. In 2021, Triller\u2019s costs of revenues were 132% of its total revenue, but that number fell to 86% in 2022. In the quarter ended March, it ticked up to 88%.\nSimilarly, Triller is slowly becoming more profitable, too. The company\u2019s operating loss narrowed to 345% of revenue in 2022 from 2,419% of revenue in 2021, and in this latest quarter, improved to 266% of revenue.\nSumming all that up, while a loss-making machine, Triller is operating in a busy and lucrative market. However, as its growth has lately been driven by acquisitions and its cost base casts long and dark shadows over its revenue, we\u2019re doubtful that Triller\u2019s IPO is the one that startups have been waiting for.\nThe market needs a bulletproof, name-brand unicorn to kick the IPO window open. Triller doesn\u2019t quite fit the bill."

The announcement confirms previous reporting by TechCrunch that Atlanta would be the next city to see Cruise vehicles on public roads.\nThe company didn\u2019t provide many details in its post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, stating only \u201cmore to come.\u201d\nNext up: Atlanta! \ud83d\ude4c\nToday we begin our initial testing across the city and we can\u2019t wait to see what each neighborhood has to offer.\nMore to come soon.\n\u2014 cruise (@Cruise) August 7, 2023\n\n\nThe announcement comes just a week since Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt said it would expand to Nashville and hinted that more cities would soon follow.\u00a0 Cruise also started initial data collection with manually driven autonomous vehicles in Los Angeles.\nThe company told TechCrunch that the operations in Atlanta are currently part of the larger testing strategy. Over the coming weeks, the company will begin initial data collection and testing in multiple cities across the country, according to the company.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean all of these test cities will become robotaxi service cities. Although it appears that Nashville will get the commercial service.\nCruise\u2019s self-driving vehicles are already on Nashville streets. A commercial ride-hailing service will follow, Cruise said without providing a specific date.\nThe burst of city expansion announcements is part of Cruise\u2019s previously stated goal to begin testing and even launch a robotaxi service in multiple, new cities, according to the company.\nA year ago, the company only operated in San Francisco. Cruise has since expanded to Austin, Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Nashville and Los Angeles.\nCruise isn\u2019t commercially operating in all of these cities just yet. Cruise has established a formula for its rollouts. The company typically enters a new market with test vehicles. Eventually, those vehicles will lose the human safety operator \u2014 making it driverless. A ride-hailing service will become available first to employees and then customers who have signed up for the service. The service area and hours often start on a limited basis and slowly expand."

        "text": "Beat the clock: 6 smart ways startups can use lawyers effectively\nWithout informing their board, a certain startup had amassed $150,000 legal fees in just three months.\nThe investor team I was part of grilled the founder to explain why. He told us the fees were for documents involving business formation, funding, various agreements, and intellectual property registrations.\nBecause fees like this can sink an early-stage startup, it\u2019s critical that founders of emerging companies know cost-effective ways to use lawyers.\nAs a founder, you can get the most out of legal help by deploying a few smart strategies that won\u2019t break the bank or blow your budget. Not everything you do requires a lawyer: You simply need to know when to engage your attorney, how much to spend, and when to do it yourself.\nYour startup needs the right legal structure. Structure depends on various factors: the nature of the business, its growth potential, funding requirements, liability considerations, and tax implications. Most startups are formed either as an LLC (limited liability company) or a C-Corp. Your business lawyer will help determine which structure best fits your company.\nAll startups enter into agreements and contracts with employees, suppliers, strategic partners, distributors and partners. It\u2019s wise to have a lawyer help draft contracts to ensure your startup\u2019s interests are protected. These three key areas require legal coverage:\nIP (intellectual property) protection:\u00a0Identify and protect your IP, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets.\nFundraising and securities law compliance: Your capital raises from investors require securities laws compliance. These laws were established to ensure transparency in investing. As an entrepreneur, you provide accurate information to your investors about their potential investment. This includes all associated risks. A lawyer will advise and help your startup navigate the process to ensure your company is compliant.\nEmployment law: When a startup hires employees, the business must comply with state, federal and different country laws that include operating and promoting a fair and inclusive workplace. To lay out the company\u2019s policies, you\u2019ll need an employee manual that an attorney can review or help create. It\u2019s equally important to have relevant agreements completed, such as employee \u201cIP assignments.\u201d This means an employee who creates intellectual property for the company, such as patents, trademarks, trade secrets or copyrights assigns all rights of ownership to the company.\nMy six smart ways for your startup to use lawyers effectively follow.\nBefore hiring a lawyer, ask other entrepreneurs, your board and advisers for referrals to prospective attorneys. Find out what they\u2019re paying for legal services in your area. This will give you a good sense of how much you\u2019ll pay and what to budget for. Ask about education, experiences and how satisfied they are with their lawyer.\nYou\u2019re better off with an attorney who specializes in the entrepreneurial ecosystem and has many years of experience with entrepreneurs. Angel investor groups often have alliances with sponsoring law firms that specialize in the startup space. Because these law firms understand the inherent risks for emerging companies, they often have experience on all sides of the complex business and intellectual property issues that startups are likely to encounter.\nProtecting your IP is one such area where experienced counsel\u2019s advice can be crucial. For example, when running my startup, we entered into a complex contract with a company to beta test our newly patented technology. This end user made an improvement they claimed was sufficient to result in their ownership of the product\u2019s entire IP. Fortunately, the contract was clear: Any improvements they made to the technology would become our intellectual property, not theirs. Without this clause our attorney had wisely added, we would have lost millions of dollars.\nDiscuss the lawyer\u2019s fee structure upfront. Let them know your budget and expectations. Attorneys who work with startups frequently have a fixed price for initial legal matters such as business formation, contracts, intellectual property protections, employment agreements and legal documents for funding. It\u2019s also fairly common for them to give startups extended payment terms.\nDon\u2019t be shy about explaining what your budget is. Ask for a detailed breakdown of legal fees and expenses \u2014 you don\u2019t want to be saddled with surprise fees and expenses that eat up your cash reserves.\nGet the name of the attorney who\u2019ll be doing the legal work on your behalf. Don\u2019t settle for someone who just graduated law school. Smaller law firms or solo practitioners are more likely to give you the experience you need along with a reasonable price. One of the lawyers we worked with had previously spent ten years at a much larger firm whose hourly billable rate was twice what we were now paying. On the other hand, it may be worth paying the premium associated with a larger law firm if you anticipate needing advice on a large array of legal matters, or matters requiring specialized legal knowledge beyond the experience of a small firm or solo practitioner.\nMake sure to get a written statement from the attorney outlining how they will calculate fees. Ask for an estimate of fees for work not just at the beginning of the relationship but on an ongoing basis until you\u2019re confident your attorney is cost-effective.\nAlways ask whether your counsel will agree to a flat fee instead of hourly fees on a matter-by-matter basis.\nBefore signing an attorney\u2019s engagement letter, be sure it sets forth a clear statement of all the terms, conditions and fees.\nDon\u2019t overlook the attorney\u2019s communication style. Note how comfortable you feel speaking with your candidate lawyer. Get a sense of whether they\u2019ll be easy to work with. Ask how they would handle a disagreement should one arise.\nI always negotiated legal fees even though I used lawyers on a regular basis at my startup. An old adage applies here: If you don\u2019t ask, you don\u2019t receive. Because I asked, I was able to reduce our company\u2019s legal costs by 25% to 30%.\nAlthough it may seem counterintuitive, negotiating legal fees can serve as an entry point to a collaborative relationship. Lawyers will respect you for this. By openly discussing fees and expectations, both parties can get a greater understanding of each other\u2019s priorities and set a budget within those priorities.\nYou may find a lawyer who isn\u2019t open to negotiating their fee. For the most part, though, I\u2019ve found fee negotiation is common and ends up benefiting both you and the attorney: You save, and the attorney gains a grateful client.\nWhether you\u2019ve successfully negotiated a flat fee or you\u2019re being billed hourly, carefully manage the time you spend with lawyers. Start by coming to meetings prepared and organized. Being armed with key points ahead of each meeting will help you stay focused and efficient.\nSome lawyers talk a lot \u2014 that\u2019s what they\u2019re trained to do. Those who bill by the hour do so in 6- or 10-minute increments. If your lawyer seems wordy and spends too much time in what you feel is superfluous discussion, watch the time and keep them moving toward the end goal of the conversation. By going into an attorney meeting with this awareness, you\u2019ll minimize your attorney\u2019s \u201con-the-clock\u201d time.\nOne attorney I worked with had a particularly slow talking tempo. It took him 30 minutes to say something he could have said in five. It felt as if he was maximizing his billable hours. I discussed the issue with him, making clear our talk would be off the clock. He was unable to change his style, so I terminated the relationship and selected another equally qualified attorney who was considerate of our budget and economical with his words.\nKnow not to call your lawyer for advice that you could be seeking elsewhere. I\u2019ve seen too many entrepreneurs make the mistake of looking to their counsel for assurance or support, then be shocked to receive a $30,000 invoice at the end of the month. Instead, go to your advisors and board members for guidance and support; they\u2019re there to help you.\nItemized billings give you a detailed picture of the work your legal team has handled for your startup during a particular time period.\nBe sure your agreement with the law firm calls for itemized monthly billing statements indicating work performed, time and who did the work, as well as any additional fees. Scrutinize invoices to ensure you\u2019re not being overcharged or billed for unnecessary items or expenses you haven\u2019t agreed to. This is particularly important at the beginning of a relationship as a way to establish what you will, and won\u2019t, pay for.\nNever be shy to question anything on a bill that doesn\u2019t seem right. And if time spent discussing the bill shows up on the next month\u2019s invoice, remind your lawyer that time spent discussing an invoice is off the clock.\nDeploy a strategy where you know ahead of time you won\u2019t need to engage your lawyer.\nFor example: Consider whether you can repurpose a contract your attorney helped create and use it in similar situations without reengaging your lawyer. You let this contract serve as a template where you replace names and other details without revising the legal terms. I regularly repurposed contracts at my startup and only brought in lawyers when we ran into unusual legal questions.\nWe had over 500 contracts; 90% of them were repurposed. These are the steps to take after you\u2019re certain you understand the \u201cboilerplate\u201d contract:\nIf you\u2019re not sure whether a particular contract involves more complex legal issues than those addressed in your template agreement, or you\u2019re uncertain about possible legal ramifications of an unusual situation, consult your lawyer. This will ensure that you protect your interests and that the modified contract is legally sound.\nYou\u2019ll save a lot of money if you adopt a mindset to be strategic about when to seek legal help. For those times when you\u2019re not sure, consult first with your board and advisors. They\u2019ll know whether it\u2019s an issue you and your team can handle or whether it\u2019s indeed time to call your lawyer."

        "text": "Callsheet for iOS offers a less cluttered, ad-free alternative to IMDb\nIf you\u2019ve ever wanted to look up information about a TV show or movie, you likely turn to IMDb to do so. But the Amazon-owned app can be frustrating to use, with prompts to log in, ads, and other clutter that can make it difficult to find what you\u2019re looking for. A new app called Callsheet, launching today, aims to improve on the IMDb experience with a clean design, several quality-of-life improvements, personalized elements and the option to subscribe instead of seeing ads.\nAs described by its creator, indie app developer Casey Liss, Callsheet is \u201csimilar to the IMDB app but . . . with respect for its users,\u201d he jokes in a blog post.\n\u201cI love watching shows and movies, and seeing who acted in them, trivia about them, and more,\u201d Liss told TechCrunch. However, he continued, \u201cthe normal app that I used for this has gotten so bad, and user-hostile, over the years. This January it occurred to me, \u2018I can do this better.\u2019 So I tried. And, I like to think, I\u2019ve mostly succeeded,\u201d Liss added.\nEssentially, Callsheet is a \u201cbespoke\u201d version of IMDb that will appeal to those who prefer a clean, modern, and well-designed experience, we believe \u2014 and are willing to pay a small fee for the upgrade.\nLike IMDb, you can look up information about a movie or show, including the cast of characters and actors who play them, crew information, release date, rating, summary, score, and more. This data is pulled from The Movie Database. But there are a number of clever touches in Callsheet that improve upon the default IMDb experience.\nAs one example, users can choose to customize a \u201cquick access\u201d button that appears next to the title and other information, like runtime and rating. Liss prefers for his button to offer one-tap access for show or movie trivia. But others may choose to customize the button to point toward other resources, like Wikipedia, Where to Watch information, a website, or parental guidance information.\nUnder the Where to Watch section, powered by JustWatch, you can toggle between the various options to see where you can stream for free, purchase the title, or what subscription services offer the show or film and in which country.\nAnother unique feature lets users toggle on and off various information that could lead to potential spoilers.\nFor instance, you can choose to hide the cast episode counts, episode titles, episode thumbnails, and cast character names \u2014 the latter something that Liss notes would have been helpful after he spoiled himself on IMDb by looking up \u201cWatchmen,\u201d where characters had hidden identities.\nHiding cast episode counts would help you from spoiling yourself about possible character deaths as well.\nYou can also pin favorite shows and movies, like those you\u2019re currently watching, to the top of the app\u2019s home screen for easy access. These pins will sync via iCloud across devices, including iPhone and iPad.\nThe app additionally offers a variety of customization options beyond your spoiler preferences and the Quick Access button, including how you want to sort a TV show\u2019s seasons, whether you want to override your region for the Where to Watch section (helpful if you stream via a VPN to access services outside your country), and your language settings for new and popular media.\nIn trying out the app, Callsheet is easier to use than IMDb, we found. In part, that\u2019s because The Movie Database\u2019s API for developers is fairly speedy, as Liss notes, but also because the app isn\u2019t filled with so much clutter. That makes it quicker to get to the information you want to see, without so much searching around and tapping.\nBecause the app is ad-free, it\u2019s supported through subscription payments. These are reasonably priced at either $1 per month or $9 per year by default, but Liss offers optional tiers for those who want to support his work further, including a $20 and $50 per year purchase option.\nLiss, also a co-host on the Accidental Tech podcast, has previously launched other useful apps like the (since deprecated) Vignette app to update contact photos and other single-purpose utilities such as MaskerAid for adding emoji to cover someone\u2019s face in a photo and\u00a0Peek-a-View that lets you safely hand your phone to someone to look at your photos without them encountering those they shouldn\u2019t.\nCallsheet is available today for download on the App Store and offers your first 20 searches for free. While an iPad version is available, Liss notes that improved iPad support is going to come ASAP."

        "text": "Colorado warns hackers stole 16 years of public school data in ransomware attack\nColorado\u2019s state government has warned students and teachers that hackers may have accessed their personal information \u2014 dating as far back as 2004.\nIn a notice on its website, the Colorado Department of Higher Education (CDHE) confirmed it experienced a ransomware incident that saw hackers access and copy data from its systems between June 11 and June 19. This data includes student and teacher names, addresses, Social Security numbers, student identification numbers, and other unspecified education records, according to CDHE.\nThe department said that those affected may include individuals who attended public higher education institutions in Colorado between 2007 and 2020 or attended a Colorado public high school between 2004 and 2020.\nAdditionally, the notice says others may be affected, including individuals with a Colorado K-12 public school educator license between 2010 and 2014; those who participated in the Dependent Tuition Assistance Program from 2009 to 2013; those who participated in Colorado Department of Education\u2019s Adult Education Initiatives programs between 2013 and 2017; or those who obtained a GED between 2007 and 2011.\nThe CDHE did not say how many people are affected by the ransomware attack, but likely encompasses a large number of individuals. The department said it plans to notify those affected, and all of those impacted are being offered two years of identity theft protection services.\nIt\u2019s not yet known who is behind the cyberattack and it doesn\u2019t appear to have yet been claimed by any of the major ransomware groups.\nColorado has suffered a spate of ransom attacks in recent weeks. Colorado State University (CSU) confirmed last month that the Clop ransomware gang had stolen sensitive personal information belonging to current and former students and employees during the recent MOVEit mass hacks. The same hackers targeted Colorado\u2019s Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, which said that personal identifiable information of those enrolled in Colorado\u2019s Medicaid program or child health plan may have been compromised.\nMillions affected by MOVEit mass-hacks as list of casualties continues to grow\n"

        "text": "Zoom launches an asynchronous video tool for the meeting-averse\nIn its continued attempt to diversify its product offerings, Zoom today launched a new asynchronous video tool, Zoom Clips, that lets users record, edit and share video clips without having to hop on a meeting.\nZoom Clips, available in public beta, provides a dedicated content library where users can manage, share, rename, search for, download or delete clips. Accessible from the desktop Zoom app, the Zoom web portal or the Mac menu bar and Windows system tray, Clips can capture both a screen and webcam feed \u2014 optionally with a virtual background \u2014 or only a portion of a user\u2019s desktop.\nOnce clips are recorded via Clips, users can add a title, description and tags; trim unwanted sections; and share the recording via email from Zoom\u2019s web portal. From that same portal, they can control who can view the clip (e.g., anyone with the link or only people in an organization), and view comments and metrics like completion rate and views.\nAs my colleague Paul Sawers pointed out to me, Zoom already offered an asynchronous video tool in its Zoom Team Chat product: video messaging. But Clips appears to be a more robust solution \u2014 and a direct response to platforms like Weet, Loom and Bubbles. (In another important distinction, video messages in Team Chat are only shareable to those in the Team Chat channel.)\n\u201cMany people are turning to asynchronous video tools as a quick and easy way to record themselves and their screens and send high-quality, short-form videos to colleagues and customers,\u201d David Ball, Zoom\u2019s meetings and chat product manager, wrote in the blog post this morning announcing Clips. \u201cWith our new asynchronous video offering, you can demonstrate important information with teammates in a pinch, add a personal touch to your collaboration or just share a detailed project update without having to join a live meeting.\u201d\nThe rise of asynchronous video comes as post-pandemic videoconferencing fatigue sets in. According to a 2022 survey, 80% of U.S. workers reported being exasperated from having to participate in frequent video calls, with 75% saying that they\u2019d declined a meeting simply because they didn\u2019t feel like attending.\nZoom, attempting to reposition itself in the face of intensified competition and slowing growth, has greatly expanded its range of products and strategic partnerships over the past year. Simultaneously, it\u2019s engaged in cost cutting, announcing the layoff of 15% of its staff earlier this year.\nJust in May, Zoom said that it would collaborate with AI startup Anthropic to bring the latter\u2019s Claude chatbot to Zoom\u2019s various apps and services. And, after adding\u00a0workplace collaboration features to compete with Slack and Calendly, including email and calendar tools, Zoom acquired Ireland-based employee communications platform Workvivo, its first purchase after customer service software startup Solvvy.\nZoom has also leaned heavily into AI technologies, including generative AI \u2014 not always with careful consideration of the consequences. Some critics argued that the sentiment analysis algorithms used in Zoom\u2019s sales assistant tool, Zoom IQ for Sales, were fundamentally flawed. Others, meanwhile, have taken issue with the company\u2019s policies around collecting customer data to train Zoom\u2019s generative AI features.\nBut its investments appear to be paying dividends. In its most recent earnings report, Zoom beat expectations, reporting fiscal Q1 net income of $15.4 million on revenue of $1.11 billion, up from $1.07 billion a year ago."

        "text": "YouTube brings high-quality 1080p option to the web\nMonths after YouTube launched an enhanced bitrate 1080p option for Premium subscribers on mobile, the platform is now bringing the video quality to the web. The company rolled out the higher-quality 1080p on iOS devices in April after an initial experiment in February.\nBringing the experience to the web allows more Premium members to watch \u201cextra crisp and clear\u201d videos, YouTube wrote in its April blog post. Enhanced bitrate is particularly great for videos with a lot of detail and motion, such as sports-related and gaming videos.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that non-enhanced 1080p is still available to non-Premium users. Standard 1080p has been available since November 2009. YouTube recently increased the price of its Premium plan, so if individual viewers want higher video quality, they have to pay $13.99/month, up from $11.99.\nThe enhanced 1080p for Premium subscribers is also available on other devices, such as TV and connected devices like Chromecasts and video game consoles, a company told TechCrunch. It\u2019s rolling out to Android devices starting today.\nStreaming service YouTube TV revealed in a Reddit post in April that it\u2019s testing a higher bitrate for live 1080p content.\nUpdated 8/7/23 at 12:50 p.m. ET with comment from YouTube.\nYouTube TV says it\u2019s experimenting with picture quality enhancements\n"

        "text": "Microsoft\u2019s Bing Chat is coming to third-party browsers, including on mobile devices\nIn late July, Microsoft confirmed its ChatGPT-like Bing Chat was testing in third-party browsers like Chrome and Safari for select users after various reports had spotted the feature in action. Today, the company directly announced that Bing Chat would \u201csoon\u201d be available in third-party browsers, including both on the web and on mobile devices.\nThe news indicates Microsoft aims to compete on AI across platforms besides its own, in addition to those places where Bing Chat is already available, like the Bing mobile app and Microsoft Edge web browser. It would also put the AI chatbot up against other browsers\u2019 built-in tools, like Google\u2019s generative AI search features, available in the Google mobile app and Chrome browser.\n\u201cThis next step in the journey allows Bing to showcase the incredible value of summarized answers, image creation and more, to a broader array of people,\u201d Microsoft explained in its announcement of the coming features, which celebrates the six-month anniversary of the AI-powered Bing. \u201cYou\u2019ll get most of the great benefits of Bing and we\u2019ll continue to optimize along the way to meet your needs across different browsers,\u201d it read.\nHowever, the company cautioned that, while the Bing Chat experience would work in users\u2019 preferred web browsers, the \u201cbest\u201d experience would be found in the Microsoft Edge browser.\nDuring tests, for example, users noticed that Bing Chat in Chrome only supported five messages per conversation, instead of the 30 available in Microsoft Edge. It was also limiting the character count to 2,000, instead of the 3,000 supported by Edge.\nMicrosoft today hinted toward these limitations, adding that with Edge, users would \u201cunlock longer conversations, chat history, and more Bing features built right into the browser.\u201d\nIn the blog post, the company also celebrated several other recently launched features, including multimodal visual search in Bing Chat \u2014 meaning the ability to search using both text and images \u2014 a feature Google first introduced back in 2021. Bing\u2019s model, however, leverages Open AI to allow users to input images into the Chat and then prompt the chatbot with related questions.\nMicrosoft additionally referenced the launch of Dark Mode for Bing Chat and the newly announced Bing Chat Enterprise, which includes commercial data protection for use inside organizations where sensitive data cannot leak out. A number of businesses have already banned employees from using consumer applications like ChatGPT due to data protection requirements, including Apple, Samsung, Walmart, Verizon\u00a0and major banks, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and JPMorgan.\nThe company also revealed a few milestones about Bing Chat to date, noting that it\u2019s since seen over 1 billion chats and over 750 million images in the chatbot in addition to nine consecutive quarters of growth on Edge.\nAn exact launch date for third-party browser support for Bing Chat was not provided, but the feature is said to be arriving soon.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Bing Chat comes to Chrome and Safari in tests for \u2018select users\u2019\n"

        "text": "French startup Exotrail expands US footprint with two new subsidiaries\nFrench in-space transportation company Exotrail is launching two U.S.-based subsidiaries, one focused specifically on serving U.S. government and defense customers, the company said Monday.\nTyler Browder, co-founder and former head of satellite software developer Kubos, was installed to lead the new Exotrail U.S., Inc. He joined Exotrail as a senior officer in February, just after the company announced it had closed a $58 million Series B. At the time, Exotrail expressed its intent to expand its footprint in the United States.\nExotrail also hired Brian Holt as the director of U.S. government business development and partnerships. Holt had previously worked for the Department of Defense\u2019s Space Security and Defense Program and at SpaceWERX, a technology-focused organization within the U.S. Space Force. By establishing a subsidiary that solely sells to the U.S. government, separate even from the other American subsidiary, Exotrail is better positioning itself to meet the particular demands and national security requirements of defense contracts.\nIn a statement, the French startup said its new American subsidiary \u201cwill commit significant resources\u201d to building out engineering and manufacturing capabilities in the States. Exotrail U.S. is currently searching for a location for a satellite factory and a separate integration facility.\n\u201cWe already have more than five customers in North America, with commercial partners ranging from traditional prime to new space operators like Astro Digital, Starfish Space, and NASA on the civil space side,\u201d Browder said in a statement. \u201cAccelerating our growth in both institutional and commercial markets is instrumental to Exotrail\u2019s future.\u201d\nExotrail is one of a handful of companies looking to provide in-space transportation services to satellite operators, though it has taken a more vertically integrated approach than some of its competitors. Its product offerings include mission analysis software, propulsion systems, and in-space mobility services. The company has more than 20 customers across North America, Europe and Asia."

        "text": "PayPal launches PYUSD stablecoin for payments and transfers\nPayPal is rolling out a stablecoin for payments and transfers, the company announced on Monday. PayPal USD (PYUSD) is issued by Paxos Trust Company and is backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S Treasuries and similar cash equivalents. PayPal says the stablecoin is rolling out to U.S. customers gradually. Today\u2019s announcement marks the first such move from a major U.S. financial institution.\nEligible U.S. PayPal customers who purchase PYUSD will be able to transfer PYUSD between PayPal and compatible external wallets, send person-to-person payments using PYUSD, fund purchases with PYUSD by selecting it at checkout and convert any of PayPal\u2019s supported cryptocurrencies to and from PYUSD.\nPayPal says that when you buy or sell cryptocurrency, including when you check out with crypto, it will disclose an exchange rate and any fees you will be charged for that transaction.\n\u201cPayPal USD is designed to reduce friction for in-experience payments in virtual environments, facilitate fast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d PayPal wrote in a press release. \u201cMost of the current volume of stablecoins is used in web3-specific environments \u2014 PayPal USD will be compatible with that ecosystem from day one and will soon be available on Venmo.\u201d\nAs an ERC-20 token issued on the Ethereum blockchain, PayPal says PYUSD will be available to a growing community of external developers, wallets and web3 applications; can be easily adopted by exchanges; and will be deployed to power experiences within the PayPal ecosystem.\nA stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to an external asset, such as the U.S. dollar. There is some controversy around stablecoins. Last year, Meta ended up abandoning its plan of having its own stablecoin, called Diem, after regulatory backlash. PayPal itself paused working on its stablecoin earlier this year amid regulatory scrutiny of crypto, as reported by Bloomberg at the time.\nPayPal first introduced crypto services back in 2020 when it began letting users in the U.S. buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies. Then, in 2021, PayPal announced the launch of Checkout with Crypto, a feature that allowed consumers to check out at millions of online businesses using cryptocurrency.\u00a0Last year, the company gave users the ability to transfer cryptocurrency from their accounts to other wallets and exchanges.\n\u201cThe shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar,\u201d said PayPal CEO and president Dan Schulman in a press release. \u201cOur commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD.\u201d\nPayPal says Paxos will publish monthly reports detailing the assets backing PYUSD starting next month. Paxos will also publish a public third-party attestation of the value of PYUSD reserve assets.\nPayPal\u2019s shares fell 7% in extended trading last Wednesday as investors were disappointed by the company\u2019s quarterly operating margin. The payment company\u2019s adjusted operating margin for the quarter came in at 21.4%, missing its forecast of 22%."
